+Additionally, we saw that the constitutive reporter concentration went down as the CRP reporter went up, and vice versa (supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1sup}.B-C).

+%Importantly, the behaviour in the regime with fast switches suggested that the concentrations of metabolic enzymes under the control of a CRP promoter can respond quickly and substantially in response to a varying input signal. 
 
 
 This led to our next question: what is the effect of these changes in metabolic enzyme concentration on the cell? 
 %
 To gauge this, we looked at how cellular growth rate responded to the fluctuations in cAMP signal. 
 %
-Figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1}.B shows that also the growth rate varied substantially, again suggesting the cell is susceptible to fluctuations in regulatory molecules. 
+Figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1}.B shows that also the growth rate varied substantially, again suggesting the cell is susceptible to fluctuations in
+the cAMP regulatory molecule. 
 %
-However, the growth rate behavior showed some puzzling features. 
+In the regime where the cAMP concentration changes hourly, 
+we see that low concentrations of cAMP correspond with lower growth rates,
+and that high concentrations of cAMP correspond with higher growth rates (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1}.B, supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:pulsingCAMPVsMu}.B).
 %
-Firstly, it appeared that in the fast switch regime the high cAMP concentration immediately results in a sustained faster growth rate.
-This is unexpected, as too much metabolic enzyme expression is expected to come with the cost of superfluous protein production, and might even lead to a detrimental unbalanced ratio of fluxes in the cell \cite{Ray2016}.
+This indicates that during the fast pulses, the range of metabolic enzyme concentrations remained below the optimal value.
 %
-However, when looking at the slower switch regime we see that this signal also goes down after while. 
+Additionally, during the fast pulses, the data points right before and after the time of switching cAMP concentration show large changes in growth rate,
+whilst there is only 20 minutes in between two datapoint and CRP controls a substantial fraction of genes in the proteome.
+This indicates that the metabolic fluxes (and therefor growth rates) might be very sensitive to the metabolic enzyme concentration in this range of enzyme concentrations. 
 %
-We can explain this seemingly erratic behavior by plotting a time trace of the growth rate against the concentration of metabolic reporter.
+%Additionally, the growth rate responds 
+%quickly to the changes in cAMP concentration,
+%which indicates that the metabolic fluxes might be very sensitive to the metabolic enzyme concentration in this range of enzyme concentrations. 
+
+
+
+During the first slow pulse (with a low concentration of cAMP), the growth rate appears to decrease almost monotonically.
+However, both during the second and third pulse (with a high and low concentration of cAMP respectively), 
+the growth rate first rises, and then decrease again.
 %
-This trace is shown in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1}.C. 
+This can also be understood in the context of the optimum curve (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig0}.B), 
+as this probably indicates the concentration of enzymes now reaches values both below and above the optimum.
+
+
+To further investigate the behavior of the cells during the pulsing experiment,
+we plotted a time trace of the growth rate against the metabolic reporter.
 %
-The most left green square in this figure indicates a switch to a low cAMP concentration, and the part of the time trace that starts at this square shows that as the metabolic reporter concentration goes down, the growth rate first goes up, and then comes down again. 
-This is consistent with the idea that metabolic enzyme concentration has an optimal value above and below which the cell grows worse \cite{Jensen1993, Dekel2005, Berkhout2013, Ray2016, Towbin2017}.
-%earlier observations which show that the relationship between growth rate and metabolic enzyme concentration shows an optimum concentration above and below which the cell grows worse.
+Some parts of this curve, especially those stemming from the slow pulses (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1}.C, arrows 8-11), can be related to the optimum curve.
 %
-The idea of an optimum metabolic enzyme concentration is also confirmed when we plot growth rate against the metabolic reporter concentration, as shown in supplemental figure \ref{fig:CRP:scatterspulsing}. 
+For example, parts indicated by arrows labeled 8 and 11 (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1}.C), seem to follow such a curve.

-Conversely, looking at the part of the trace that starts at the leftmost red square, the reporter concentration appears not to be affected, but the growth rate does go up.

+%The behaviour of the trace that stems from the fast pulses (arrows 1-7, figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1}.C) is puzzling.
 %
-An explanation for this part of the trace not overlapping with the earlier discussed part of the trace, and the quick growth rate response without concentration change, 
-could be that cAMP also has some post-translational roles in the cell. 
-This would explain the quick responses both in the fast-switching regime and the quick response to an upshift of cAMP.
-
-
-If there were a post-translational role for cAMP, then the concentration of cAMP should show a more consistent relation with growth rate than the concentration of metabolic reporter.
+During fast pulses, growth rates seem to change considerably in comparison with the change in metabolic reporter,
+and moreover the overall slope of the trace seems to be negative.
+%
+This is striking, as we previously 
 %
-%The concentration of CRP.cAMP should be proportional with the cAMP concentration, and so should the production of our metabolic reporter.
-The production rate of our metabolic reporter should be proportional to the cAMP concentration, 
-so the metabolic reporter production rate could serve as a proxy for cAMP concentration.
+%We previously 
+determined --- based on the supplied cAMP concentration and observed growth rates --- 
+that during fast pulses the concentration of enzymes remained lower than the optimal concentration.
 %
-However, this production rate also depends on the growth rate of the cell, and might do so in a non-trivial manner.
-Indeed, it is difficult to find a straightforward explanation for the relationship between production and growth over time, as shown in supplemental figure \ref{fig:CRP:productiontimeevolutions}.
-Only when the metabolic production is normalized against a second reporter with a constitutive promoter (see figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig0}.B) as a reference, do we see that most traces overlap.
+In contradiction, the negative slope of the trace in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1}.C now seems to suggests the opposite, 
+namely that the concentration of metabolic enzymes is above the optimum.
+%However, the relation between the metabolic reporter concentration and cellular growth appears to be negatively sloped,
+%which would suggest --- in contradiction with our earlier observation --- the concentration of metabolic enzymes is above optimum.
+%However, here, we see that the slope of the concentration-growth trace appears to be mostly negative.
 %
-(Such a normalization could also be done for the concentration, which appears to make the traces slightly more reproducible, but not substantially different.)
+An explanation for this disagreement, and for the fact that the trace doesn't adhere to a single path, 
+%does not neatly reproduce an optimum curve,
+could be that
+%An explanation for this disagreement might be that
+expression of the metabolic promoter and expression of metabolic enzymes is not 
+%expression from the metabolic reporter promoter and
+%expression from other metabolic promoters that affect growth rate is not 
+completely synchronous.
+%metabolic reporter gene expression and 
+%the expression of metabolic genes is not completely synchronous.
 %
-The larger overlap in the normalized production vs growth time trace (compared to the concentration of metabolic reporter vs. growth) offers some support for a post-translational role of cAMP.
+For example, there could be a delay between expression from the reporter gene and the expression of other CRP-controlled genes.
 %
-In \ecoli however, cAMP is usually described as an activator of the translational regulator CRP protein only \cite{gorke2008, keseler2017}.
+Given that not all promoters that respond to CRP are equal, both in gene sequence and location in the chromosome,
+it would not be surprising if the behavior of the CRP-responsive promoters is more rich
+than a simple response in unison.
 
-Nevertheless, the observations made in this pulsing experiment show that the CRP system can respond to quickly fluctuating input signals, as also might occur due to stochastic fluctuations.
+
+Nevertheless, 
+taken together, %despite the fact that we do not fully understand the rich behavior of the CRP system,
+the observations from the pulsing experiment show that we can control and monitor CRP-induced expression by extracellular cAMP in a dynamical manner,
+and that the cell responds to cAMP pulses that occur on sub cell-cycle, which indicates that it might also respond to stochastic fluctuations.

+%
+To further probe the behavior of cellular populations,

+%To further investigate the behaviour of cells , we exposed our $\Delta$cAMP cells to two additional constant conditions:

+
+
+Reassuringly,
+for the metabolic reporter and growth rate,
+the population average relationship appears to follow an optimum curve for these three conditions (i.e. growth in medium with 80, 800 or 5000 $\upmu$M cAMP),

+%

+%for these three conditions (growth in medium with 80, 800 or 5000 $\upmu$M cAMP)

+%
+This is consistent with the optimum curve we observed in bulk experiments (figure \ref{fig:CRP:ocurvePlatereader}) and 
+optimum curves observed in earlier experiments \cite{Towbin2017}.

+Strikingly, we see that also for the constitutive reporter,

+%Interestingly, we see that also for the constitutive reporter and growth rate, 
+%the population average relationship

+%
+This observation prompted us to 
+think about the relationship between the concentrations of the two reporters, 
+and hypothesize that 
+an increase in metabolic protein expression leads to a mandatory equal decrease in constitutive protein expression and vice versa.
+%
+Such an effect might

+%be attributed to

+which indeed appears to be the case (supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:averagerelations1}, bottom left panel); see also supplementary note I.
+%
+This allowed us to predict a trend line for the population average relationship between constitutive reporter and growth rate,
+which appears consistent with our data (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2}.B). 
+%
+%As mentioned, 
+Besides the concentrations of reporters,
+we can also quantify the production rates of the reporters in single cells. 
+%We can also look at the production rate of reporters,
+These 
+%which 
+show striking population average relationships with growth rate (supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2sup}).
+%
+However, in supplementary note I, we show that the population average production rates (both for the metabolic and constitutive reporter) 
+can be predicted well by 
+the concentration, growth rate, 
+and a simple mathematical model.
+%
+This model was also 
+used to generate algebraic curves that describe
+%for 
+the relationship between production rate and growth rate, 
+that appear to be consistent with the population average relationships between these two quantities (supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2sup}).
+%
+We also plotted
+the relationship between the concentrations of the two reporters,
+and the relationship between the production rates of the two reporters (supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3scatters_CC_pp});
+the population average curves for these two relationships can also be determined from the 
+fact that the sum of the concentrations remains constant and by using aforementioned mathematical model, respectively.
+%
+Thus,
+the relationships between the population average parameters can be captured well by a few rules and a simple model.
+%
+In the next paragraph, we will discuss the behavior of single cells, which
+appears to deviate from the relationships that we observed for population averages.
+
+
+
+%The behavior of cells on the level of population averages is reasonably straightforward to understand.
+%%
+%As we show in supplementary note I at the end of this chapter, the steady state relationships between the protein expression and growth 
+%can be understood using % a mathematical description and 
+%the following three observations:
+%%are determined by three ingredients:
+%(1) the interaction between protein production and dilution sets a protein's concentration (supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:averagerelations1}, top panels), 
+%(2) an increase in metabolic protein expression leads to a mandatory equal decrease in constitutive protein expression and vice versa 
+%(likely due to limitations on the total protein budget of the cell; see supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:averagerelations1}, bottom left panel), 
+%and 
+%(3) as also previously observed, there is an optimality relationship between metabolic enzyme expression and growth (supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:averagerelations1}, bottom right panel).

+%
+For both strains, the cross-correlations show positive values, 
+but the correlations at positive delays are more pronounced in the $\Delta$cAMP strain (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.A-B).

+%the positive $R_{p,\mu}$ values at zero delay are reflected by positive slopes in the scatter clouds of the metabolic reporter (supplemental figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2sup}, top panels).
+
+
+
+
+Next, we examined the behavior of the constitutive reporter,
+to investigate whether the difference in dynamics between wild type and feedbackless cells are indeed due to CRP regulation
+and not due to an overall change in protein expression-growth dynamics.
+%
+%As with the scatter plots, we wanted to check whether these changes in cellular behaviour are specific to CRP regulation,

 %
-When we use the metabolic production rates $p_M$ to calculate $R_{p_M,\mu}$ cross-correlations, we see a similar difference between wild type cells and $\Delta$cAMP cells as in the $R_{M,\mu}$ curves:
-the wild type cells show more correlation on the left side of the y-axis (albeit slightly positive correlations), whilst the $\Delta$cAMP cells show more correlation on the right side of the y-axis.
+%Two observations can be made from the cross-correlation curves of the constitutive reporter (\ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.C-D).

+%Firstly, the curves for the wild type and $\Delta$cAMP cells are highly similar.
 %
-To this end, we generated cross-correlations $R_{Q,\mu}$ and $R_{p_Q,\mu}$, which correlate the concentration $Q$ and production $p_Q$ of the constitutive reporter $Q$ with growth $\mu$.

+are affected by the feedback loop in the CRP system,

-Secondly, the constitutive reporter dynamics as shown by the $R(\tau)$ curves (figures \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.C-D) appear very similar to the dynamics of metabolism and growth in the wild type cells (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.A).

-Strikingly, indeed, we saw that if we add feedback to the mixed scenario presented in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig4}.E, it began to resemble the dilution mode --- as presented in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig4}.F.
+This is indeed consistent with the cross-correlation curve that we saw for the wild type cells that still possess the feedback regulation \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.A.
 %
+Thus, since the possession of the feedback loop is the key difference between
+the wild type and \dcamp strain, this suggests we can attribute the change in dynamics between \dcamp and wild type cells to the negative feedback.
+%
+Our model shows that the change in dynamics is consistent with a scenario where wild type cells 
+experience fluctuation from many sources --- as shown by the mixed mode for the \dcamp cells ---
+but that transmission of these fluctuations is negated by the negative feedback loop.

 Thus, although this model is rather simple and a biological cell much more complicated, %it could give a hint of what is going on in the cell:
 the cross-correlations are consistent with modeling results 
 in which the CRP-regulation by negative feedback plays an active role even in a constant environment.

 To calculate the production rate (a.u. px$^{-1}$ min$^{-1}$), first the sum of the fluorescence signal (a.u.) over all pixels that make up a cell is calculated. 
 For each frame $n$ where a fluorescence image was taken, the production rate is determined as the slope of a linear fit through three points $n-\delta{n}$, $n$, and $n+\delta{n}$, where $\delta{n}$ is the interval at which fluorescence pictures are taken. This production rate is then subsequently divided by the total number of pixels of the cell in frame $n$.
