 This could be indicative of a situation where ribosomes are more limiting due to the antibiotic stress, and fluctuations transmit from ribosomal fluctuations to the growth rate of the cell.
 %
 Production rate-growth CCs of the S2 reporter, shown in figure \ref{fig:ribo:CCsPmuS2}, are harder to interpret, both for M9 medium and M9 medium with antibiotics.
 They are however not inconsistent with the earlier observations and interpretation.

 %
 This indicates that either repetitions of these experiments might yield different results, or one of the labels does not appropriately reflect ribosomal concentration, or different ribosomal proteins might have their own dynamics.

 Production-growth CCs of the L9 reporter (figure \ref{fig:ribo:CCsPmuL9}) are again hard to interpret, although the condition with antibiotic stress shows a distinct peak around zero delay.
