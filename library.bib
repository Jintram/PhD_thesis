abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tetracyclines are among the most used antibiotics in livestock worldwide. Resistance is widely disseminated in Escherichia coli, where it is generally mediated by tetracycline efflux pumps, such as TetA. Expression of tetracycline efflux pumps is tightly controlled by the repressor TetR, which has been shown to be tetracycline-responsive at sub-MIC tetracycline concentrations. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of increasing tetracycline concentrations on the growth of TetA-producing E. coli, and to determine how expression of tetA and tetR related to each other in different growth phases in the presence of tetracycline.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: A tetracycline resistant E. coli strain containing tetA and tetR on the chromosome was constructed and cultured in the presence of increasing concentrations of tetracycline. Expression of tetR and tetA was measured at four time points in different growth phases by quantitative real-time PCR. The TetA-producing E. coli exhibited prolonged lag phase with increasing concentrations of tetracycline, while expression of tetA and tetR increased and decreased, respectively, with increasing tetracycline concentration. The levels of tetA and tetR mRNA varied depending on growth phase, resulting in a gradual decrease of the tetA/tetR ratio from approximately 4 in the lag phase to approximately 2 in the stationary phase.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This study shows that the expression of tetR and tetA is tetracycline concentration- and growth phase-dependent, contributing to improved understanding of the relationships between E. coli growth, tetracycline exposure and expression of tetracycline resistance.},

abstract = {Most time lapse microscopy experiments studying bacterial processes ie growth, progression through the cell cycle and motility have been performed on thin nutrient agar pads. An important limitation of this approach is that dynamic perturbations of the experimental conditions cannot be easily performed. In eukaryotic cell biology, fluidic approaches have been largely used to study the impact of rapid environmental perturbations on live cells and in real time. However, all these approaches are not easily applicable to bacterial cells because the substrata are in all cases specific and also because microfluidics nanotechnology requires a complex lithography for the study of micrometer sized bacterial cells. In fact, in many cases agar is the experimental solid substratum on which bacteria can move or even grow. For these reasons, we designed a novel hybrid micro fluidic device that combines a thin agar pad and a custom flow chamber. By studying several examples, we show that this system allows real time analysis of a broad array of biological processes such as growth, development and motility. Thus, the flow chamber system will be an essential tool to study any process that take place on an agar surface at the single cell level.},

abstract = {One of the least-explored aspects of cholesterol-enriched domains (rafts) in cells is the coupling between such domains in the external and internal monolayers and its potential to modulate transbilayer signal transduction. Here, we employed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to study the effects of antibody-mediated patching of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) proteins [raft-resident wild-type HA and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored HA, or the nonraft mutant HA(2A520)] on the lateral diffusion of internal-leaflet raft and nonraft Ras isoforms (H-Ras and K-Ras, respectively). Our studies demonstrate that the clustering of outer-leaflet or transmembrane raft-associated HA proteins (but not their nonraft mutants) retards the lateral diffusion of H-Ras (but not K-Ras), suggesting stabilized interactions of H-Ras with the clusters of raft-associated HA proteins. These modulations were paralleled by specific effects on the activity of H-Ras but not of the nonraft K-Ras. Thus, clustering raft-associated HA proteins facilitated the early step whereby H-Ras is converted to an activated, GTP-loaded state but inhibited the ensuing step of downstream signaling via the Mek/Erk pathway. We propose a model for the modulation of transbilayer signaling by clustering of raft proteins, where external clustering (antibody or ligand mediated) enhances the association of internal-leaflet proteins with the stabilized clusters, promoting either enhancement or inhibition of signaling.},

abstract = {Biofilm development and quorum sensing (QS) are closely interconnected processes. Biofilm formation is a cooperative group behaviour that involves bacterial populations living embedded in a self-produced extracellular matrix. QS is a cell-cell communication mechanism that synchronizes gene expression in response to population cell density. Intuitively, it would appear that QS might coordinate the switch to a biofilm lifestyle when the population density reaches a threshold level. However, compelling evidence obtained in different bacterial species coincides in that activation of QS occurs in the formed biofilm and activates the maturation and disassembly of the biofilm in a coordinate manner. The aim of this review is to illustrate, using four bacterial pathogens as examples, the emergent concept that QS activates the biofilm dispersion process.},

abstract = {Synthetic genetic circuits are programmed in living cells to perform predetermined cellular functions. However, designing higher-order genetic circuits for sophisticated cellular activities remains a substantial challenge. Here we program a genetic circuit that executes Pavlovian-like conditioning, an archetypical sequential-logic function, in Escherichia coli. The circuit design is first specified by the subfunctions that are necessary for the single simultaneous conditioning, and is further genetically implemented using four function modules. During this process, quantitative analysis is applied to the optimization of the modules and fine-tuning of the interconnections. Analogous to classical Pavlovian conditioning, the resultant circuit enables the cells to respond to a certain stimulus only after a conditioning process. We show that, although the conditioning is digital in single cells, a dynamically progressive conditioning process emerges at the population level. This circuit, together with its rational design strategy, is a key step towards the implementation of more sophisticated cellular computing.},

abstract = {One of the major unsolved problems of modern biology is deep understanding of the complex relationship between the information encoded in the genome of an organism and the phenotypic properties manifested by that organism. Fundamental advances must be made before we can begin to approach the goal of predicting the phenotypic consequences of a given mutation or an organism's response to a novel environmental challenge. Although this problem is often portrayed as if the task were to find a more or less direct link between genotypic and phenotypic levels, on closer examination the relationship is far more layered and complex. Although there are some intuitive notions of what is meant by phenotype at the level of the organism, it is far from clear what this term means at the biochemical level. We have described design principles that are readily revealed by representation of molecular systems in an appropriate design space. Here, we first describe a generic approach to the construction of such a design space in which qualitatively distinct phenotypes can be identified and counted. Second, we show how the boundaries between these phenotypic regions provide a method of characterizing a system's tolerance to large changes in the values of its parameters. Third, we illustrate the approach for one of the most basic modules of biochemical networks and describe an associated design principle. Finally, we discuss the scaling of this approach to large systems.},

abstract = {Recent discoveries have suggested the concept that intracellular signals are the sum of multiple, site-specified subsignals, rather than single, homogeneous entities. In the context of cancer, searching for compounds that selectively block subsignals essential for tumor progression, but not those regulating "house-keeping" functions, could help in producing drugs with reduced side effects compared to compounds that block signaling completely. The Ras-ERK pathway has become a paradigm of how space can differentially shape signaling. Today, we know that Ras proteins are found in different plasma membrane microdomains and endomembranes. At these localizations, Ras is subject to site-specific regulatory mechanisms, distinctively engaging effector pathways and switching-on diverse genetic programs to generate different biological responses. The Ras effector pathway leading to ERKs activation is also under strict, space-related regulatory processes. These findings may open a gate for aiming at the Ras-ERK pathway in a spatially restricted fashion, in our quest for new anti-tumor therapies.},

abstract = {The goal of systems biology is to understand the behavior of the whole in terms of knowledge of the parts. This is hard to achieve in many cases due to the difficulty of characterizing the many constituents involved in a biological system and their complex web of interactions. The lac promoter of Escherichia coli offers the possibility of confronting "system-level" properties of transcriptional regulation with the known biochemistry of the molecular constituents and their mutual interactions. Such confrontations can reveal previously unknown constituents and interactions, as well as offer insight into how the components work together as a whole. Here we study the combinatorial control of the lac promoter by the regulators Lac repressor (LacR) and cAMP-receptor protein (CRP). A previous in vivo study [Setty Y, Mayo AE, Surette MG, Alon U (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100:7702-7707] found gross disagreement between the observed promoter activities and the expected behavior based on the known molecular mechanisms. We repeated the study by identifying and removing several extraneous factors that significantly modulated the expression of the lac promoter. Through quantitative, systematic characterization of promoter activity for a number of key mutants and guided by the thermodynamic model of transcriptional regulation, we were able to account for the combinatorial control of the lac promoter quantitatively, in terms of a cooperative interaction between CRP and LacR-mediated DNA looping. Specifically, our analysis indicates that the sensitivity of the inducer response results from LacR-mediated DNA looping, which is significantly enhanced by CRP.},

abstract = {As the ability to analyze individual cells in microbial populations expands, it is becoming apparent that isogenic microbial populations contain substantial cell-to-cell differences in physiological parameters such as growth rate, resistance to stress and regulatory circuit output. Subpopulations exist that are manyfold different in these parameters from the population average, and these differences arise by stochastic processes. Such differences can dramatically affect the response of cells to perturbations, especially stress, which in turn dictates overall population response. Defining the role of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in population behavior is important for understanding population-based research problems, including those involving infecting populations, normal flora and bacterial populations in water and soils. Emerging technological breakthroughs are poised to transform single-cell analysis and are critical for the next phase of insights into physiological heterogeneity in the near future. These include technologies for multiparameter analysis of live cells, with downstream processing and analysis.},

abstract = {The identification of human sequence polymorphisms that regulate gene expression is key to understanding human genetic diseases. We report a survey of human genes that demonstrate allelic differences in gene expression, reflecting the presence of putative allele-specific cis-acting factors of either genetic or epigenetic nature. The expression of allelic transcripts in heterozygous samples is assessed directly by relative quantitation of intragenic marker alleles in messenger or heteronuclear RNA derived from cells or tissues. This survey used 193 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 129 genes expressed in lymphoblastoid cell lines, to identify 23 genes (18{\%}) with common allele-specific transcripts whose expression deviated from the expected equimolar ratio. A subset of these deviations, or "allelic imbalances," can be observed in multiple samples derived from reference CEPH ("Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain") pedigrees and demonstrate a spectrum of patterns of transmission, including cosegregation of allelic skewing across generations compatible with Mendelian inheritance as well as random monoallelic expression for three genes (IL1A, HTR2A, and FGB). Additional studies for BTN3A2 provide evidence of SNPs and haplotypes in complete linkage disequilibrium with high- and low-expressing transcripts. The pipeline described herein offers tools for efficient identification and characterization of allelic expression allowing identification of regulatory sequence variants as well as epigenetic variation affecting human gene expression.},

abstract = {Random fluctuations in gene expression lead to wide cell-to-cell differences in RNA and protein counts. Most efforts to understand stochastic gene expression focus on local (intrinisic) fluctuations, which have an exact theoretical representation. However, no framework exists to model global (extrinsic) mechanisms of stochasticity. We address this problem by dissecting the sources of stochasticity that influence the expression of a yeast heat shock gene, SSA1. Our observations suggest that extrinsic stochasticity does not influence every step of gene expression, but rather arises specifically from cell-to-cell differences in the propensity to transcribe RNA. This led us to propose a framework for stochastic gene expression where transcription rates vary globally in combination with local, gene-specific fluctuations in all steps of gene expression. The proposed model better explains total expression stochasticity than the prevailing ON-OFF model and offers transcription as the specific mechanism underlying correlated fluctuations in gene expression.},

abstract = {Multidimensional energy landscapes are an intrinsic property of proteins and define their dynamic behavior as well as their response to external stimuli. In order to explore the energy landscape and its implications on the dynamic function of proteins dynamic force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations have proved to be important tools. In this study, these techniques have been employed to analyze the influence of the direction of the probing forces on the complex of an antibody fragment with its peptide antigen. Using an atomic force microscope, experiments were performed where the attachment points of the 12 amino acid long peptide antigen were varied. These measurements yielded clearly distinguishable basal dissociation rates and potential widths, proving that the direction of the applied force determines the unbinding pathway. Complementary atomistic SMD simulations were performed, which also show that the unbinding pathways of the system are dependent on the pulling direction. However, the main barrier to be crossed was independent of the pulling direction and is represented by a backbone hydrogen bond between Gly(H)-H40 of the antibody fragment and Glu(Oepsilon)-6(peptide) of the peptide. For each pulling direction, the observed barriers can be correlated with the rupture of specific interactions, which stabilize the bound complex. Furthermore, although the SMD simulations were performed at loading rates exceeding the experimental rates by orders of magnitude due to computational limitations, a detailed comparison of the barriers that were overcome in the SMD simulations with the data obtained from the atomic force microscope unbinding experiments show excellent agreement.},

abstract = {The spatial structure of the cell is highly organized at all levels: from small complexes and assemblies, to local nano- and microclusters, to global, micrometer scales across and between cells. We suggest that this multiscale spatial cell organization also organizes signaling and coordinates cellular behavior. We propose a new view of the spatial structure of cell signaling systems. This new view describes cell signaling in terms of dynamic allosteric interactions within and among distinct, spatially organized transient clusters. The clusters vary over time and space and are on length scales from nanometers to micrometers. When considered across these length scales, primary factors in the spatial organization are cell membrane domains and the actin cytoskeleton, both also highly dynamic. A key challenge is to understand the interplay across these multiple scales, link it to the physicochemical basis of the conformational behavior of single molecules and ultimately relate it to cellular function. Overall, our premise is that at these scales, cell signaling should be thought of not primarily as a sequence of diffusion-controlled molecular collisions, but instead transient, allostery-driven cluster re-forming interactions.},

abstract = {We have investigated the inhibition by SulA of the assembly of Escherichia coli FtsZ. Using quantitative GTPase and fluorescence assays, we found that SulA inhibition resulted in an increase in the apparent critical concentration for FtsZ assembly. The increase in apparent critical concentration was always less than the total amount of SulA added, suggesting that the association of SulA and FtsZ was of modest affinity. Isothermal titration calorimetry gave a value of 0.78 $\mu$M for the dissociation constant of the FtsZ-SulA complex, similar in magnitude to the 0.72 $\mu$M critical concentration of FtsZ protofilament assembly at steady state. We modeled the reaction as an equilibrium competition between (a) FtsZ subunits assembling onto protofilaments or (b) binding SulA. When FtsZ was assembled in GMPCPP or in EDTA, the inhibition by SulA was reduced. The reduced inhibition could be explained by a 3- and 10-fold weaker binding of SulA to FtsZ. The mutant D212G, which has no GTPase activity and therefore minimal subunit cycling, was shown here to assemble one-stranded protofilaments, and the assembly was blocked by SulA. We also assayed the SulA and FtsZ proteins from Pseudomonas. The SulA inhibition was stronger than with the E. coli proteins, and the model indicated a 5-fold higher affinity of Pseudomonas SulA for FtsZ.},

We studied the sex chromosomes of Drosophila miranda, where a neo-Y chromosome originated only approximately 1 million years ago. Whole-genome and transcriptome analysis reveals massive degeneration of the neo-Y, that male-beneficial genes on the neo-Y are more likely to undergo accelerated protein evolution, and that neo-Y genes evolve biased expression toward male-specific tissues--the shrinking gene content of the neo-Y becomes masculinized. In contrast, although older X chromosomes show a paucity of genes expressed in male tissues, neo-X genes highly expressed in male-specific tissues undergo increased rates of protein evolution if haploid in males. Thus, the response to sex-specific selection can shift at different stages of X differentiation, resulting in masculinization or demasculinization of the X-chromosomal gene content.},

abstract = {The activation of Ras by the guanine nucleotide-exchange factor Son of sevenless (Sos) constitutes the rate-limiting step in the transduction process that links receptor tyrosine kinases to Ras-triggered intracellular signalling pathways. A prerequisite for the function of Sos in this context is its ligand-dependent membrane recruitment, and the prevailing model implicates both the Sos carboxy-terminal proline-rich motifs and amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in this process. Here, we describe a previously unrecognized pathway for the PH domain-dependent membrane recruitment of Sos that is initiated by the growth factor-induced generation of phosphatidic acid via the signalling enzyme phospholipase D2 (PLD2). Phosphatidic acid interacts with a defined site in the Sos PH domain with high affinity and specificity. This interaction is essential for epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced Sos membrane recruitment and Ras activation. Our findings establish a crucial role for PLD2 in the coupling of extracellular signals to Sos-mediated Ras activation, and provide new insights into the spatial coordination of this activation event.},

abstract = {The dynamic behavior of metabolic networks is governed by numerous regulatory mechanisms, such as reversible phosphorylation, binding of allosteric effectors or temporal gene expression, by which the activity of the participating enzymes can be adjusted to the functional requirements of the cell. For most of the cellular enzymes, such regulatory mechanisms are at best qualitatively known, whereas detailed enzyme-kinetic models are lacking. To explore the possible dynamic behavior of metabolic networks in cases of lacking or incomplete enzyme-kinetic information, we present a computational approach based on structural kinetic modeling. We derive statistical measures for the relative impact of enzyme-kinetic parameters on dynamic properties (such as local stability) and apply our approach to the metabolism of human erythrocytes. Our findings show that allosteric enzyme regulation significantly enhances the stability of the network and extends its potential dynamic behavior. Moreover, our approach allows to differentiate quantitatively between metabolic states related to senescence and metabolic collapse of the human erythrocyte. We think that the proposed method represents an important intermediate step on the long way from topological network analysis to detailed kinetic modeling of complex metabolic networks.},

Whether slow growth in a rare subset of cells underlies the persistence phenotype has not be examined in wild-type bacteria. Here, we show that an exponentially growing population of wild-type Escherichia coli cells produces rare cells that stochastically switch into slow growth, that the slow-growing cells are multidrug tolerant, and that they are able to resuscitate. The persistence phenotype depends hierarchically on the signaling nucleotide (p)ppGpp, Lon protease, inorganic polyphosphate, and toxin-antitoxins. We show that the level of (p)ppGpp varies stochastically in a population of exponentially growing cells and that the high (p)ppGpp level in rare cells induces slow growth and persistence. (p)ppGpp triggers slow growth by activating toxin-antitoxin loci through a regulatory cascade depending on inorganic polyphosphate and Lon protease. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Furthermore, it is impossible for a regulatory program to guarantee optimal expression levels in all conditions.

Thus rates and reaction topologies are often treated as adjustable parameters. Here we present a general stochastic modeling method for small chemical and biochemical systems with emphasis on feedback systems. The method, Maximum Caliber (MaxCal), is more parsimonious than others in constructing dynamical models requiring fewer model assumptions and parameters to capture the effects of feedback. MaxCal is the dynamical analogue of Maximum Entropy. It uses average rate quantities and correlations obtained from short experimental trajectories to construct dynamical models. We illustrate the method on the bistable genetic toggle switch. To test our method, we generate synthetic data from an underlying stochastic model. MaxCal reliably infers the statistics of the stochastic bistability and other full dynamical distributions of the simulated data, without having to invoke complex reaction schemes. The method should be broadly applicable to other systems.},

abstract = {Although much has been done to elucidate the biochemistry of signal transduction and gene regulatory pathways, it remains difficult to understand or predict quantitative responses. We integrate single-cell experiments with stochastic analyses, to identify predictive models of transcriptional dynamics for the osmotic stress response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We generate models with varying complexity and use parameter estimation and cross-validation analyses to select the most predictive model. This model yields insight into several dynamical features, including multistep regulation and switchlike activation for several osmosensitive genes. Furthermore, the model correctly predicts the transcriptional dynamics of cells in response to different environmental and genetic perturbations. Because our approach is general, it should facilitate a predictive understanding for signal-activated transcription of other genes in other pathways or organisms.},

abstract = {Blocks in DNA replication cause a rapid arrest of cell division in Escherichia coli. We have previously established that the function SfiA (SulA), induced under these conditions as part of the SOS response, is involved in this inhibition of division. To separate the effects of SfiA from those of other SOS functions, we have constructed a plac-sfiA operon fusion, permitting specific induction of SfiA protein by addition of the lac operon inducer isopropyl beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). In lon mutants, in which the unstable SfiA protein has a longer half-life, IPTG caused a rapid arrest of cell division. Under these conditions, there is no concomitant induction of the SOS response. IPTG also caused a rapid arrest of cell division in lon+ strains. These results demonstrate that induction of the SfiA protein is sufficient to cause inhibition of division. Mutations in the sfiB gene can suppress IPTG-induced SfiA-mediated inhibition of division. At higher SfiA concentrations, however, even sfiB mutants cease division; an additional mutation genetically inseparable from sfiB restores normal division. These observations reinforce the hypothesis that the SfiB protein, probably required for cell septation, is the target of action of the SfiA division inhibitor.},

abstract = {Cellular biochemical networks have to function in a noisy environment using imperfect components. In particular, networks involved in gene regulation or signal transduction allow only for small output tolerances, and the underlying network structures can be expected to have undergone evolution for inherent robustness against perturbations. Here we combine theoretical and experimental analyses to investigate an optimal design for the signalling network of bacterial chemotaxis, one of the most thoroughly studied signalling networks in biology. We experimentally determine the extent of intercellular variations in the expression levels of chemotaxis proteins and use computer simulations to quantify the robustness of several hypothetical chemotaxis pathway topologies to such gene expression noise. We demonstrate that among these topologies the experimentally established chemotaxis network of Escherichia coli has the smallest sufficiently robust network structure, allowing accurate chemotactic response for almost all individuals within a population. Our results suggest that this pathway has evolved to show an optimal chemotactic performance while minimizing the cost of resources associated with high levels of protein expression. Moreover, the underlying topological design principles compensating for intercellular variations seem to be highly conserved among bacterial chemosensory systems.},

abstract = {Experiments in recent years have vividly demonstrated that gene expression can be highly stochastic. How protein concentration fluctuations affect the growth rate of a population of cells is, however, a wide-open question. We present a mathematical model that makes it possible to quantify the effect of protein concentration fluctuations on the growth rate of a population of genetically identical cells. The model predicts that the population's growth rate depends on how the growth rate of a single cell varies with protein concentration, the variance of the protein concentration fluctuations, and the correlation time of these fluctuations. The model also predicts that when the average concentration of a protein is close to the value that maximizes the growth rate, fluctuations in its concentration always reduce the growth rate. However, when the average protein concentration deviates sufficiently from the optimal level, fluctuations can enhance the growth rate of the population, even when the growth rate of a cell depends linearly on the protein concentration. The model also shows that the ensemble or population average of a quantity, such as the average protein expression level or its variance, is in general not equal to its time average as obtained from tracing a single cell and its descendants. We apply our model to perform a cost-benefit analysis of gene regulatory control. Our analysis predicts that the optimal expression level of a gene regulatory protein is determined by the trade-off between the cost of synthesizing the regulatory protein and the benefit of minimizing the fluctuations in the expression of its target gene. We discuss possible experiments that could test our predictions.},

Since telomeres play an important role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability associated with continuous cell division, a key question for the quality of the resulting reprogrammed cells was to address whether nuclear reprogramming involves a full rejuvenation of telomeres. Recent work from our group and others demonstrate that telomeres are indeed rejuvenated during nuclear reprogramming. These findings also revealed that the structure of telomeric chromatin is dynamic and controlled by epigenetic programmes, which are reversed by reprogramming.},

abstract = {The stress response promoter element (STRE) confers increased transcription to a set of genes following environmental or metabolic stress in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A lambda gt11 library was screened to isolate clones encoding STRE-binding proteins, and one such gene was identified as MSN2, which encoded a zinc-finger transcriptional activator. Disruption of the MSN2 gene abolished an STRE-binding activity in crude extracts as judged by both gel mobility-shift and Southwestern blot experiments, and overexpression of MSN2 intensified this binding activity. Northern blot analysis demonstrated that for the known or suspected STRE-regulated genes DDR2, CTT1, HSP12, and TPS2, transcript induction was impaired following heat shock or DNA damage treatment in the msn2-disrupted strain and was constitutively activated in a strain overexpressing MSN2. Furthermore, heat shock induction of a STRE-driven reporter gene was reduced more than 6-fold in the msn2 strain relative to wild-type cells. Taken together, these data indicate that Msn2p is the transcription factor that activates STRE-regulated genes in response to stress. Whereas nearly 85{\%} of STRE-mediated heat shock induction was MSN2 dependent, there was significant MSN2-independent expression. We present evidence that the MSN2 homolog, MSN4, can partially replace MSN2 for transcriptional activation following stress. Moreover, our data provides evidence for the involvement of additional transcription factors in the yeast multistress response.},

abstract = {The bacterial type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a dynamic organelle that bacteria use to target prey cells for inhibition via translocation of effector proteins. Time-lapse fluorescence microscopy has documented striking dynamics of opposed T6SS organelles in adjacent sister cells of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Such cell-cell interactions have been termed "T6SS dueling" and likely reflect a biological process that is driven by T6SS antibacterial attack. Here, we show that T6SS dueling behavior strongly influences the ability of P. aeruginosa to prey upon heterologous bacterial species. We show that, in the case of P. aeruginosa, T6SS-dependent killing of either Vibrio cholerae or Acinetobacter baylyi is greatly stimulated by T6SS activity occurring in those prey species. Our data suggest that, in P. aeruginosa, T6SS organelle assembly and lethal counterattack are regulated by a signal that corresponds to the point of attack of the T6SS apparatus elaborated by a second aggressive T6SS + bacterial cell.

abstract = {Recently, a set of 766 genes that are enriched in the ovary as compared to the soma was identified by microarray analysis [1]. Here, we report a functional analysis of 98{\%} of these genes by RNA interference (RNAi). Over half the genes tested showed at least one detectable phenotype, most commonly embryonic lethality, consistent with the expectation that ovary transcripts would be enriched for genes that are essential in basic cellular and developmental processes. We find that essential genes are more likely to be conserved and to be highly expressed in the ovary. We extend previous observations and find that fewer than the expected number of ovary-expressed essential genes are present on the X chromosome. We characterized early embryonic defects for 161 genes and used time-lapse microscopy to systematically describe the defects for each gene in terms of 47 RNAi-associated phenotypes. In this paper, we discuss the use of these data to group genes into "phenoclusters"; in the accompanying paper, we use these data as one component in the integration of different types of large-scale functional analyses. We find that phenoclusters correlate well with sequence-based functional predictions and thus may be useful in predicting functions of uncharacterized genes.},

Here we present a general methodology for analyzing the fidelity with which different statistics of a fluctuating input are represented, or encoded, in the output of a signaling system over time. We identify two orthogonal sources of error that corrupt perfect representation of the signal: dynamical error, which occurs when the network responds on average to other features of the input trajectory as well as to the signal of interest, and mechanistic error, which occurs because biochemical reactions comprising the signaling mechanism are stochastic. Trade-offs between these two errors can determine the system's fidelity. By developing mathematical approaches to derive dynamics conditional on input trajectories we can show, for example, that increased biochemical noise (mechanistic error) can improve fidelity and that both negative and positive feedback degrade fidelity, for standard models of genetic autoregulation. For a group of cells, the fidelity of the collective output exceeds that of an individual cell and negative feedback then typically becomes beneficial. We can also predict the dynamic signal for which a given system has highest fidelity and, conversely, how to modify the network design to maximize fidelity for a given dynamic signal. Our approach is general, has applications to both systems and synthetic biology, and will help underpin studies of cellular behavior in natural, dynamic environments.},

Y chromosomes have evolved independently many times, and the associated change in gene dosage in the heterogametic (XY) sex is often compensated for by regulatory mechanisms which ensure equal amounts of gene products of X-linked loci in males and females. There have recently been substantial advances in our knowledge of the molecular biology and genetics of sex chromosomes and dosage compensation, and in our understanding of the population genetic processes which are involved in their evolution.},

Cells have one housekeeping factor and a variable number of alternative sigma factors that possess different promoter-recognition properties.

Recent structural information illuminates the process of initiation and also shows that the two key sigma domains are structurally conserved, even among diverse family members. We use the sigma repertoire of Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces coelicolor, and cyanobacteria to illustrate the different strategies utilized to organize transcriptional space using multiple sigma factors.},

abstract = {Noise, or random fluctuations, in gene expression may produce variability in cellular behavior. To measure the noise intrinsic to eukaryotic gene expression, we quantified the differences in expression of two alleles in a diploid cell. We found that such noise is gene-specific and not dependent on the regulatory pathway or absolute rate of expression. We propose a model in which the balance between promoter activation and transcription influences the variability in messenger RNA levels. To confirm the predictions of our model, we identified both cis- and trans-acting mutations that alter the noise of gene expression. These mutations suggest that noise is an evolvable trait that can be optimized to balance fidelity and diversity in eukaryotic gene expression.},

abstract = {The four vertebrate R-spondin proteins are secreted agonists of the canonical Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling pathway. These proteins are approximately 35 kDa, and are characterized by two amino-terminal furin-like repeats, which are necessary and sufficient for Wnt signal potentiation, and a thrombospondin domain situated more towards the carboxyl terminus that can bind matrix glycosaminoglycans and/or proteoglycans. Although R-spondins are unable to initiate Wnt signaling, they can potently enhance responses to low-dose Wnt proteins. In humans, rare disruptions of the gene encoding R-spondin1 cause a syndrome of XX sex reversal (phenotypic male), palmoplantar keratosis (a thickening of the palms and soles caused by excess keratin formation) and predisposition to squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Mutations in the gene encoding R-spondin4 cause anonychia (absence or hypoplasia of nails on fingers and toes). Recently, leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor (Lgr)4, Lgr5 and Lgr6, three closely related orphans of the leucine-rich repeat family of G-protein-coupled receptors, have been identified as receptors for R-spondins. Lgr5 and Lgr6 are markers for adult stem cells. Because R-spondins are potent stimulators of adult stem cell proliferation in vivo and in vitro, these findings might guide the therapeutic use of R-spondins in regenerative medicine.},

abstract = {A knock-out mutant of the dinR gene that encodes the SOS regulon repressor in Bacillus subtilis was constructed. The yneA, yneB and ynzC genes transcribed divergently from the dinR gene were strongly induced in mutant cells. Northern hybridization analyses revealed that these genes collectively form an operon and belong to the SOS regulon. The simultaneous deletion of dinR and yneA suppressed the filamentous phenotype of the dinR mutant. Furthermore, although yneA is suppressed in the wild-type cell in the absence of SOS induction, artificial expression of the YneA protein using an IPTG-inducible promoter resulted in cell elongation. Disruption of yneA significantly reduced cell elongation after the induction of the SOS response by mitomycin C in dinR+ cells. These results indicate that the YneA protein is responsible for cell division suppression during the SOS response in B. subtilis. Localization of the FtsZ protein to the cell division site was reduced in dinR-disrupted or yneA-expressing cells, further suggesting that the YneA protein suppresses cell division through the suppression of FtsZ ring formation. Interestingly, the B. subtilis YneA protein is structurally and phylogenetically unrelated to its functional counterpart in Escherichia coli, SulA.},

The value of labeling and visualizing proteins in living cells is evident from the thousands of publications since the cloning of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Biologists have been flooded with a cornucopia of FPs; however, the FP toolbox has not necessarily been optimized for cell biologists. Common FP plasmids are suboptimal for the construction of proteins fused to FP. More problematic are commercial and investigator-constructed FP-fusion proteins that disrupt important cellular targeting information. Even when cell biologists correctly construct FP-fusion proteins, it is rarely self-evident which FP should be used. Important FP information, such as oligomer formation or photostability, is often obscure or anecdotal. This brief guide is offered to assist the biologist to exploit FPs in the analysis of cellular processes.},

The degree of translational feedback regulation by L1, the L11 operon-specific translational repressor protein, was changed by altering the site on the "L11 mRNA" where L1 interacts. The half-life of the overproduced L11 mRNA increased by about fivefold when translational repression was abolished, while the half-life of mRNA from the spc ribosomal protein operon, which is not translationally regulated by L1, stayed constant. Furthermore, the half-life of L11 operon mRNA carrying an additional mutation in the ribosome binding site that abolishes translation remains short. This indicates that the change in half-life observed during increased gene dosage is due to translational repression by L1 and is probably a consequence of L1 blocking translation of L11 mRNA and not due to some nucleolytic activity mediated by L1. ?? 1986.},

Recently, multiply-primed rolling circle amplification (MPRCA) has been applied to overcome the problems of the DNA cloning via host cells. However, when MPRCA is used to amplify from minute quantities of DNA template, the products are mostly by-product DNA molecules generated by false priming and primer dimer formation. This study demonstrates that MPRCA using random RNA primers[{\#}x02014]instead of DNA primers[{\#}x02014]blocked the synthesis of by-products and succeeded in amplifying one copy of a circular DNA molecule more than 1012-fold to give microgram quantities of amplification product without using submicroliter reaction volumes. Furthermore, a ligation strategy was elaborated to circularize only the desired DNA sequence and eliminate undesired ligation-products. A combination of these methods was able to amplify and ligate a large construct without undesired DNA sequences and at microgram quantities within one day. Therefore, these methods have the possibility to improve DNA cloning techniques that have been restricted by the limitations of PCR methods or by the host cell.},

abstract = {During aerobic growth of Escherichia coli on acetate as sole source of carbon and energy, the organism requires the operation of the glyoxylate bypass enzymes, namely isocitrate lyase (ICL) and the anaplerotic enzyme malate synthase (MS). Under these conditions, the glyoxylate bypass enzyme ICL is in direct competition with the Krebs cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) for their common substrate and although ICDH has a much higher affinity for isocitrate, flux of carbon through ICL is assured by virtue of high intracellular level of isocitrate and the reversible phosphorylation/inactivation of a large fraction of ICDH. Reversible inactivation is due to reversible phosphorylation catalysed by ICDH kinase/phosphatase, which harbours both catalytic activities on the same polypeptide. The catalytic activities of ICDH kinase/phosphatase constitute a moiety conserved cycle, require ATP and exhibit 'zero-order ultrasensitivity'. The structural gene encoding ICDH kinase/phosphatase (aceK) together with those encoding ICL (aceA) and MS (aceB) form an operon (aceBAK; otherwise known as the ace operon) the expression of which is intricately regulated at the transcriptional level by IclR, FadR, FruR and IHF. Although ICDH, an NADP(+)-dependent, non-allosteric dimer, can be phosphorylated at multiple sites, it is the phosphorylation of the Ser-113 residue that renders the enzyme catalytically inactive as it prevents isocitrate from binding to the active site, which is a consequence of the negative charge carried on phosphoserine 113 and the conformational change associated with it. The ICDH molecule readily undergo domain shifts and/or induced-fit conformational changes to accommodate the binding of ICDH kinase/phosphatase, the function of which has now been shown to be central to successful adaptation and growth of E. coli and related genera on acetate and fatty acids.},

abstract = {Microbial engineering often requires fine control over protein expression--for example, to connect genetic circuits or control flux through a metabolic pathway. To circumvent the need for trial and error optimization, we developed a predictive method for designing synthetic ribosome binding sites, enabling a rational control over the protein expression level. Experimental validation of {\textgreater}100 predictions in Escherichia coli showed that the method is accurate to within a factor of 2.3 over a range of 100,000-fold. The design method also correctly predicted that reusing identical ribosome binding site sequences in different genetic contexts can result in different protein expression levels. We demonstrate the method's utility by rationally optimizing protein expression to connect a genetic sensor to a synthetic circuit. The proposed forward engineering approach should accelerate the construction and systematic optimization of large genetic systems.},

abstract = {Gene expression noise is a universal phenomenon across all life forms. Although beneficial under certain circumstances, expression noise is generally thought to be deleterious. However, neither the magnitude of the deleterious effect nor the primary mechanism of this effect is known. Here, we model the impact of expression noise on the fitness of unicellular organisms by considering the influence of suboptimal expressions of enzymes on the rate of biomass production and the energetic cost associated with imprecise amounts of protein synthesis. Our theoretical modeling and empirical analysis of yeast data show four findings. (i) Expression noise reduces the mean fitness of a cell by at least 25{\%}, and this reduction cannot be substantially alleviated by gene overexpression. (ii) Higher sensitivity of fitness to the expression fluctuations of essential genes than nonessential genes creates stronger selection against noise in essential genes, resulting in a decrease in their noise. (iii) Reduction of expression noise by genome doubling offers a substantial fitness advantage to diploids over haploids, even in the absence of sex. (iv) Expression noise generates fitness variation among isogenic cells, which lowers the efficacy of natural selection similar to the effect of population shrinkage. Thus, expression noise renders organisms both less adapted and less adaptable. Because expression noise is only one of many manifestations of the stochasticity in cellular molecular processes, our results suggest a much more fundamental role of molecular stochasticity in evolution than is currently appreciated.},

@article{Hornung2008,
abstract = {Interactions between genes and proteins are crucial for efficient processing of internal or external signals, but this connectivity also amplifies stochastic fluctuations by propagating noise between components. Linear (unbranched) cascades were shown to exhibit an interplay between the sensitivity to changes in input signals and the ability to buffer noise. We searched for biological circuits that can maintain signaling sensitivity while minimizing noise propagation, focusing on cases where the noise is characterized by rapid fluctuations. Negative feedback can buffer this type of noise, but this buffering comes at the expense of an even greater reduction in signaling sensitivity. By systematically analyzing three-component circuits, we identify positive feedback as a central motif allowing for the buffering of propagated noise while maintaining sensitivity to long-term changes in input signals. We show analytically that noise reduction in the presence of positive feedback results from improved averaging of rapid fluctuations over time, and discuss in detail a particular implementation in the control of nutrient homeostasis in yeast. As the design of biological networks optimizes for multiple constraints, positive feedback can be used to improve sensitivity without a compromise in the ability to buffer propagated noise.},

abstract = {Lactic acid bacteria have been isolated from living, harvested, and fermented plant materials; however, the adaptations these bacteria possess for growth on plant tissues are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated plant habitat-specific traits of Lactococcus lactis during growth in an Arabidopsis thaliana leaf tissue lysate (ATL). L. lactis KF147, a strain originally isolated from plants, exhibited a higher growth rate and reached 7.9-fold-greater cell densities during growth in ATL than the dairy-associated strain L. lactis IL1403. Transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) of KF147 identified 853 induced and 264 repressed genes during growth in ATL compared to that in GM17 laboratory culture medium. Genes induced in ATL included those involved in the arginine deiminase pathway and a total of 140 carbohydrate transport and metabolism genes, many of which are involved in xylose, arabinose, cellobiose, and hemicellulose metabolism. The induction of those genes corresponded with L. lactis KF147 nutrient consumption and production of metabolic end products in ATL as measured by gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF/MS) untargeted metabolomic profiling. To assess the importance of specific plant-inducible genes for L. lactis growth in ATL, xylose metabolism was targeted for gene knockout mutagenesis. Wild-type L. lactis strain KF147 but not an xylA deletion mutant was able to grow using xylose as the sole carbon source. However, both strains grew to similarly high levels in ATL, indicating redundancy in L. lactis carbohydrate metabolism on plant tissues. These findings show that certain strains of L. lactis are well adapted for growth on plants and possess specific traits relevant for plant-based food, fuel, and feed fermentations.},

abstract = {The growth of single isogenic cells in the same environment shows a large degree of variability with consequences for resistance to antibiotics, chemotherapy, and environmental stress. In order to characterize the transcriptional differences associated with this variability, we developed a method â FitFlow â that enables physical sorting of subpopulations based on growth rate differences. We find that slow growing subpopulations in yeast have a substantially altered transcriptome that, to a limited extent, resembles that of cells growing slowly in a nutrient-limited chemostat. The cells of the slow growing subpopulation show a transcriptional stress response and have a high level of transcriptional diversity: they express more genes, novel transcripts, antisense transcripts, and genes on the 2-micron plasmid and from two endogenous viruses. Moreover, the slow subpopulation up-regulates transposons, and has reduced RNA polymerase fidelity. Finally, the slow cells show a transcriptional and post-translational DNA damage response, and addition of an antioxidant reduces the size of the slow subpopulation. Our results therefore suggest that the slow growing subpopulation explores a larger genotypic -and so phenotypic -space.},

Recent publications report on ABI4 as a regulatory factor in diverse processes. In developing seedlings, ABI4 mediates sugar signaling, lipid breakdown, and plastid-to-nucleus signaling.

abstract = {Flux balance analysis (FBA) of a genome-scale metabolic model allows calculation of intracellular fluxes by optimizing an objective function, such as maximization of cell growth, under given constraints, and has found numerous applications in the field of systems biology and biotechnology. Due to the underdetermined nature of the system, however, it has limitations such as inaccurate prediction of fluxes and existence of multiple solutions for an optimal objective value. Here, we report a strategy for accurate prediction of metabolic fluxes by FBA combined with systematic and condition-independent constraints that restrict the achievable flux ranges of grouped reactions by genomic context and flux-converging pattern analyses. Analyses of three types of genomic contexts, conserved genomic neighborhood, gene fusion events, and co-occurrence of genes across multiple organisms, were performed to suggest a group of fluxes that are likely on or off simultaneously. The flux ranges of these grouped reactions were constrained by flux-converging pattern analysis. FBA of the Escherichia coli genome-scale metabolic model was carried out under several different genotypic (pykF, zwf, ppc, and sucA mutants) and environmental (altered carbon source) conditions by applying these constraints, which resulted in flux values that were in good agreement with the experimentally measured (13)C-based fluxes. Thus, this strategy will be useful for accurately predicting the intracellular fluxes of large metabolic networks when their experimental determination is difficult.},

Quantitative S1 assays indicated that the steady-state levels of crp mRNA were markedly reduced in cells harboring the deletion plasmids. Evidence was also presented to show that the crp mRNAs produced from deletion plasmids are less stable than that from the intact crp gene. In vitro transcription assays revealed that the putative crp terminator is indeed a rho-independent terminator. Using the galK expression system and Northern blot analysis we showed that the crp terminator is functional in vivo. Moreover it was shown that the deletion mutations in the stem region of the crp terminator cause a significant readthrough. We conclude that the 3'-flanking sequence of the crp gene acts to stabilize its own mRNA as well as to terminate transcription.},

However, traditional techniques based on population averages 'wash out' crucial dynamics that are either unsynchronized between cells or are driven by fluctuations, or 'noise', in cellular components. Recently, the combination of time-lapse microscopy, quantitative image analysis and fluorescent protein reporters has enabled direct observation of multiple cellular components over time in individual cells. In conjunction with mathematical modelling, these techniques are now providing powerful insights into genetic circuit behaviour in diverse microbial systems.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that the DNA, RNA and protein content of Enterobacteriaceae is regulated as a function of exponential growth rates; macromolecular content increases with faster growth regardless of specific composition of the growth medium. This phenomenon, called growth rate control, primarily involves regulation of ribosomal RNA and ribosomal protein synthesis. However, it was uncertain whether the global regulator ppGpp is the major determinant for growth rate control. Therefore, here we re-evaluate the effect of ppGpp on macromolecular content for different balanced growth rates in defined media. We find that when ppGpp is absent, RNA/protein and RNA/DNA ratios are equivalent in fast and slow growing cells. Moreover, slow growing ppGpp-deficient cells with increased RNA content, display a normal ribosomal subunit composition although polysome content is reduced when compared with fast growing wild-type cells. From this we conclude that growth rate control does not occur in the absence of ppGpp. Also, artificial elevation of ppGpp or introduction of stringent RNA polymerase mutants in ppGpp-deficient cells restores this control. We believe these findings strongly argue in favour of ppGpp and against redundant regulation of growth rate control by other factors in Escherichia coli and other enteric bacteria.},

Herein, we demonstrate that the microenvironment from which Ras signals emanate determines which substrates will be preferentially phosphorylated by the activated ERK1/2. We show that the phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) and cytosolic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)) is most prominent when ERK1/2 are activated from lipid rafts, whereas RSK1 is mainly activated by Ras signals from the disordered membrane. We present evidence indicating that the underlying mechanism of this substrate selectivity is governed by the participation of different scaffold proteins that distinctively couple ERK1/2, activated at defined microlocalizations, to specific substrates. As such, we show that for cPLA(2) activation, ERK1/2 activated at lipid rafts interact with KSR1, whereas ERK1/2 activated at the endoplasmic reticulum utilize Sef-1. To phosphorylate the EGFr, ERK1/2 activated at lipid rafts require the participation of IQGAP1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that scaffold usage markedly influences the biological outcome of Ras site-specific signals. These results disclose an unprecedented spatial regulation of ERK1/2 substrate specificity, dictated by the microlocalization from which Ras signals originate and by the selection of specific scaffold proteins.},

However, current knowledge about these "lipid rafts", in live cells is limited. One way to obtain insight into the occurrence and the size of lipid rafts is the use of single-molecule microscopy, which allows one to study the diffusive motion of individual molecules with high positional and temporal accuracy. Using this technique, we compared the diffusion behavior of the Lck membrane anchor, which has a high affinity for lipid rafts, to the diffusion behavior of the K-Ras membrane anchor, which has negligible affinity for rafts and compared the results with those of the H-Ras membrane anchor. Surprisingly, we found only minor differences in the diffusion behavior of the various lipid anchors, indicating that putative cytoplasmic leaflet lipid rafts would have to be small ({\textless}137 nm diameter) and do not affect the mobility of membrane-anchored molecules much on timescales up to 60 ms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The lateral segregation of Ras proteins into transient plasma membrane nanoclusters is essential for high-fidelity signal transmission by the Ras mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. In this spatially constrained signaling system, the dynamics of Ras nanocluster assembly and disassembly control MAPK signal output. RESULTS: We show here that BRaf inhibitors paradoxically activate CRaf and MAPK signaling in Ras transformed cells by profoundly dysregulating Ras nanocluster dynamics. Specifically, BRaf inhibitors selectively enhance the plasma membrane nanoclustering of oncogenic K-Ras and N-Ras but have no effect on H-Ras nanoclustering. Raf inhibitors are known to drive the formation of stable BRaf-CRaf and CRaf-CRaf dimers. Our results demonstrate that the presence of two Ras-binding domains in a single Raf dimer is sufficient and required to increase Ras nanoclustering, indicating that Raf dimers promote K- and N-Ras nanocluster formation by crosslinking constituent Ras proteins. Ras crosslinking increases the fraction of K-Ras and N-Ras in their cognate nanoclusters, leading to an increase in MAPK output from the plasma membrane. Intriguingly, increased MAPK signaling in BRaf inhibited cells is accompanied by significantly decreased Akt activation. We show that this signal pathway crosstalk results from a novel mechanism of competition between stabilized Raf dimers and p110$\alpha$ for recruitment to Ras nanoclusters. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal that BRaf inhibitors disrupt Ras nanocluster dynamics with significant, yet divergent, consequences for MAPK and PI3K signaling.},

abstract = {Bacteria have developed several strategies to communicate and compete with one another in complex environments. One important mechanism of inter-bacterial competition is contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI), in which Gram-negative bacteria use CdiB/CdiA two-partner secretion proteins to suppress the growth of neighboring target cells. CdiB is an Omp85 outer-membrane protein that exports and assembles CdiA exoproteins onto the inhibitor cell surface. CdiA binds to receptors on susceptible bacteria and subsequently delivers its C-terminal toxin domain (CdiA-CT) into the target cell. CDI systems also encode CdiI immunity proteins, which specifically bind to the CdiA-CT and neutralize its toxin activity, thereby protecting CDI+ cells from auto-inhibition. Remarkably, CdiA-CT sequences are highly variable between bacteria, as are the corresponding CdiI immunity proteins. Variations in CDI toxin/immunity proteins suggest that these systems function in bacterial self/non-self recognition and thereby play an important role in microbial communities. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the biochemistry, structural biology and physiology of CDI.},

abstract = {Efflux pump genes and proteins are present in both antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Pumps may be specific for one substrate or may transport a range of structurally dissimilar compounds (including antibiotics of multiple classes); such pumps can be associated with multiple drug (antibiotic) resistance (MDR). However, the clinical relevance of efflux-mediated resistance is species, drug, and infection dependent. This review focuses on chromosomally encoded pumps in bacteria that cause infections in humans. Recent structural data provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of drug transport. MDR efflux pumps contribute to antibiotic resistance in bacteria in several ways: (i) inherent resistance to an entire class of agents, (ii) inherent resistance to specific agents, and (iii) resistance conferred by overexpression of an efflux pump. Enhanced efflux can be mediated by mutations in (i) the local repressor gene, (ii) a global regulatory gene, (iii) the promoter region of the transporter gene, or (iv) insertion elements upstream of the transporter gene. Some data suggest that resistance nodulation division systems are important in pathogenicity and/or survival in a particular ecological niche. Inhibitors of various efflux pump systems have been described; typically these are plant alkaloids, but as yet no product has been marketed.},

abstract = {The dynamic features of a genetic network's response to environmental fluctuations represent essential functional specifications and thus may constrain the possible choices of network architecture and kinetic parameters. To explore the connection between dynamics and network design, we have analyzed a general regulatory architecture that is commonly found in many metabolic pathways. Such architecture is characterized by a dual control mechanism, with end product feedback inhibition and transcriptional regulation mediated by an intermediate metabolite. As a case study, we measured with high temporal resolution the induction profiles of the enzymes in the leucine biosynthetic pathway in response to leucine depletion, using an automated system for monitoring protein expression levels in single cells. All the genes in the pathway are known to be coregulated by the same transcription factors, but we observed drastically different dynamic responses for enzymes upstream and immediately downstream of the key control point-the intermediate metabolite alpha-isopropylmalate (alphaIPM), which couples metabolic activity to transcriptional regulation. Analysis based on genetic perturbations suggests that the observed dynamics are due to differential regulation by the leucine branch-specific transcription factor Leu3, and that the downstream enzymes are strictly controlled and highly expressed only when alphaIPM is available. These observations allow us to build a simplified mathematical model that accounts for the observed dynamics and can correctly predict the pathway's response to new perturbations. Our model also suggests that transient dynamics and steady state can be separately tuned and that the high induction levels of the downstream enzymes are necessary for fast leucine recovery. It is likely that principles emerging from this work can reveal how gene regulation has evolved to optimize performance in other metabolic pathways with similar architecture.},

Since that time, paramutation-like phenomena have been reported in other maize genes, other plants, fungi, and animals. Paramutation can occur between endogenous genes, two transgenes or an endogenous gene, and transgene. Recent results indicate that paramutation involves RNA-mediated heritable chromatin changes and a number of genes implicated in RNAi pathways. However, not all aspects of paramutation can be explained by known mechanisms of RNAi-mediated transcriptional silencing.},

abstract = {Cellular signaling pathways do not simply transmit data; they integrate and process signals to operate as switches, oscillators, logic gates, memory modules and many other types of control system. These complex processing capabilities enable cells to respond appropriately to the myriad of external cues that direct growth and development. The idea that crosstalk and feedback loops are used as control systems in biological signaling networks is well established. Signaling networks are also subject to exquisite spatial regulation, yet how spatial control modulates signal outputs is less well understood. Here, we explore the spatial organization of two different signal transduction circuits: receptor tyrosine kinase activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase module; and glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptor activation of phospholipase C. With regards to these pathways, recent results have refocused attention on the crucial role of lipid rafts and plasma membrane nanodomains in signal transmission. We identify common design principals that highlight how the spatial organization of signal transduction circuits can be used as a fundamental control mechanism to modulate system outputs in vivo.},

abstract = {One of the key ways in which microbes are thought to regulate their metabolism is by modulating the availability of enzymes through transcriptional regulation. However, the limited success of efforts to manipulate metabolic fluxes by rewiring the transcriptional network has cast doubt on the idea that transcript abundance controls metabolic fluxes. In this study, we investigate control of metabolic flux in the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis by quantifying fluxes, transcripts, and metabolites in eight metabolic states enforced by different environmental conditions. We find that most enzymes whose flux switches between on and off states, such as those involved in substrate uptake, exhibit large corresponding transcriptional changes. However, for the majority of enzymes in central metabolism, enzyme concentrations were insufficient to explain the observed fluxes--only for a number of reactions in the tricarboxylic acid cycle were enzyme changes approximately proportional to flux changes. Surprisingly, substrate changes revealed by metabolomics were also insufficient to explain observed fluxes, leaving a large role for allosteric regulation and enzyme modification in the control of metabolic fluxes.},

@article{Shinar2007,
abstract = {Biological signaling systems produce an output, such as the level of a phosphorylated protein, in response to defined input signals. The output level as a function of the input level is called the system's input-output relation. One may ask whether this input-output relation is sensitive to changes in the concentrations of the system's components, such as proteins and ATP. Because component concentrations often vary from cell to cell, it might be expected that the input-output relation will likewise vary. If this is the case, different cells exposed to the same input signal will display different outputs. Such variability can be deleterious in systems where survival depends on accurate match of output to input. Here we suggest a mechanism that can provide input-output robustness, that is, an input-output relation that does not depend on variations in the concentrations of any of the system's components. The mechanism is based on certain bacterial signaling systems. It explains how specific molecular details can work together to provide robustness. Moreover, it suggests an approach that can help identify a wide family of nonequilibrium mechanisms that potentially have robust input-output relations.},

abstract = {Thermal fluctuations can lead to significant, unpredictable concentration changes in intracellular molecules, potentially disrupting the functioning of cellular networks and challenging cellular efficiency. Biochemical systems might therefore be expected to have evolved network architectures and motifs that limit the effects of stochastic disturbances. During gene expression itself, stochasticity, or "noise", in protein concentrations is believed to be determined mostly by mRNA, rather than protein, levels. Here, we demonstrate in silico, and analytically, how a number of commonly occurring network architectures in bacteria use mRNA to efficiently attenuate fluctuations. Genes coded in operons share mRNA, which we show generates strongly correlated expression despite multiple ribosome binding sites. For autogeneous control, we provide general analytic expressions using Langevin theory, and demonstrate that negative translational feedback has a much greater efficiency at reducing stochasticity than negative transcriptional feedback. Using the ribosomal proteins as an example, we also show that translational, rather than transcriptional, feedback best coordinates gene expression during assembly of macromolecular complexes. Our findings suggest that selection of a gene controlled post-transcriptionally may be for the resulting low stochasticity in its expression. Such low noise genes can be speculated to play a central role in the local gene network.},

MIG1 protein binds to two sites in the upstream region of SUC2, a yeast gene that is repressed by glucose. The MIG1 sites closely resemble the sequence recognized by the Egr proteins.

However, there are no methods to systematically identify functional allosteric protein-metabolite interactions. Here we present an experimental and computational approach for using dynamic metabolite data to discover allosteric regulation that is relevant in vivo. By switching the culture conditions of Escherichia coli every 30 s between medium containing either pyruvate or (13)C-labeled fructose or glucose, we measured the reversal of flux through glycolysis pathways and observed rapid changes in metabolite concentration. We fit these data to a kinetic model of glycolysis and systematically tested the consequences of 126 putative allosteric interactions on metabolite dynamics. We identified allosteric interactions that govern the reversible switch between gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, including one by which pyruvate activates fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. Thus, from large sets of putative allosteric interactions, our approach can identify the most likely ones and provide hypotheses about their function.},

abstract = {In Escherichia coli, tetracycline prevents translation. When subject to tetracycline, E. coli express TetA to pump it out by a mechanism that is sensitive, while fairly independent of cellular metabolism. We constructed a target gene, PtetA-mRFP1-96BS, with a 96 MS2-GFP binding site array in a single-copy BAC vector, whose expression is controlled by the tetA promoter. We measured the in vivo kinetics of production of individual RNA molecules of the target gene as a function of inducer concentration and temperature. From the distributions of intervals between transcription events, we find that RNA production by PtetA is a sub-Poissonian process. Next, we infer the number and duration of the prominent sequential steps in transcription initiation by maximum likelihood estimation. Under full induction and at optimal temperature, we observe three major steps. We find that the kinetics of RNA production under the control of PtetA, including number and duration of the steps, varies with induction strength and temperature. The results are supported by a set of logical pairwise Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. We conclude that the expression of TetA is controlled by a sequential mechanism that is robust, whereas sensitive to external signals.},

This approach may be useful for interpreting single-molecule or few-particle experiments on molecular motors, enzyme reactions, ion-channels, and phosphorylation-driven biological clocks. We consider cycles where all biochemical states are observable. Our method shows how: (1) the noise in cycles increases with cycle size and decreases with the driving force that spins the cycle and (2) provides a recipe for estimating small-number features, such as probability of backward spin in small cycles, from experimental data. The back-spin probability diminishes exponentially with the deviation from equilibrium. We believe this method may also be useful for other few-particle nonequilibrium biochemical reaction systems.},

abstract = {The Human Genome Project was completed a decade ago, leaving a legacy of process, tools, and infrastructure now being turned to the study of the microbes that reside in and on the human body as determinants of health and disease, and has been branded "The Human Microbiome Project." Of the various niches under investigation, the human gut houses the most complex and abundant microbial community and is an arena for important host-microbial interactions that have both local and systemic impact. Initial studies of the human microbiome have been largely descriptive, a testing ground for innovative molecular techniques and new hypotheses. Methods for studying the microbiome have quickly evolved from low-resolution surveys of microbial community structure to high-definition description of composition, function, and ecology. Next-generation sequencing technologies combined with advanced bioinformatics place us at the doorstep of revolutionary insight into the composition, capability, and activity of the human intestinal microbiome. Renewed efforts to cultivate previously "uncultivable" microbes will be important to the overall understanding of gut ecology. There remain numerous methodological challenges to the effective study and understanding of the gut microbiome, largely relating to study design, sample collection, and the number of predictor variables. Strategic collaboration of clinicians, microbiologists, molecular biologists, computational scientists, and bioinformaticians is the ideal paradigm for success in this field. Meaningful interpretation of the gut microbiome requires that host genetic and environmental influences be controlled or accounted for. Understanding the gut microbiome in healthy humans is a foundation for discovering its influence in various important gastrointestinal and nutritional diseases (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, and obesity), and for rational translation to human health gains. ?? 2012 Mosby, Inc.

abstract = {Phenotypic variability in populations of cells has been linked to evolutionary robustness to stressful conditions. A remarkable example of the importance of cell-to-cell variability is found in bacterial persistence, where subpopulations of dormant bacteria, termed persisters, were shown to be responsible for the persistence of the population to antibiotic treatments. Here, we use microfluidic devices to monitor the induction of fluorescent proteins under synthetic promoters and characterize the dormant state of single persister bacteria. Surprisingly, we observe that protein production does take place in supposedly dormant bacteria, over a narrow time window after the exit from stationary phase. Only thereafter does protein production stop, suggesting that differentiation into persisters fully develops over this time window and not during starvation, as previously believed. In effect, we observe that exposure of bacteria to antibiotics during this time window significantly reduces persistence. Our results point to new strategies to fight persistent bacterial infections. The quantitative measurement of single-cell induction presented in this study should shed light on the processes leading to the dormancy of subpopulations in different systems, such as in subpopulations of viable but nonculturable bacteria, or those of quiescent cancer cells.},

abstract = {Chop is a ubiquitously expressed mammalian gene encoding a small nuclear protein related to the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors. CHOP protein plays an important role in various cellular processes such as growth, differentiation and programmed cell death. CHOP expression is strongly increased in response to a large variety of stresses including perturbation of the endoplasmic reticulum function, DNA damage and nutrient deprivation. Multiple mechanisms including transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls are involved in the regulation of CHOP expression. We show here that the 5'UTR of the Chop transcript plays an important role in controlling the synthesis of CHOP protein. In particular, the 5'UTR contains a conserved uORF which encodes a 31 amino acid peptide that inhibits the expression of the downstream ORF. Mutational analysis of the 5' leader region and peptide coding sequences suggests that the peptide itself inhibits expression of the downstream ORF. Such results suggest a role for uORF in limiting ribosomal access to downstream initiation sites. With respect to the importance of CHOP protein in the regulation of cellular functions, the mechanisms that regulate its basal level are of considerable interest.},

abstract = {The genetic and biochemical networks which underlie such things as homeostasis in metabolism and the developmental programs of living cells, must withstand considerable variations and random perturbations of biochemical parameters. These occur as transient changes in, for example, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation. The intensity and duration of these perturbations differ between cells in a population. The unique state of cells, and thus the diversity in a population, is owing to the different environmental stimuli the individual cells experience and the inherent stochastic nature of biochemical processes (for example, refs 5 and 6). It has been proposed, but not demonstrated, that autoregulatory, negative feedback loops in gene circuits provide stability, thereby limiting the range over which the concentrations of network components fluctuate. Here we have designed and constructed simple gene circuits consisting of a regulator and transcriptional repressor modules in Escherichia coli and we show the gain of stability produced by negative feedback.},

We measured in a systematic way the relation between cellular growth rates and the key parameters of catabolite repression, i.e., the phosphorylated EIIA(Crr) (EIIA(Crr) approximately P) level and the cAMP level, using in vitro and in vivo assays. Different growth rates were obtained by using either various carbon sources or by growing the cells with limited concentrations of glucose, sucrose, and mannitol in continuous bioreactor experiments. The ratio of EIIA(Crr) to EIIA(Crr) approximately P and the intracellular cAMP concentrations, deduced from the activity of a cAMP-CRP-dependent promoter, correlated well with specific growth rates between 0.3 h(-1) and 0.7 h(-1), corresponding to generation times of about 138 and 60 min, respectively. Below and above this range, these parameters were increasingly uncoupled from the growth rate, which perhaps indicates an increasing role executed by other global control systems, in particular the stringent-relaxed response system.},

Two of the best-studied SMC complexes are cohesin and condensin. Cohesin is required to hold sister chromatids together, which allows their bio-orientation on the mitotic spindle. Cleavage of cohesin's kleisin subunit by the separase protease then triggers the movement of sister chromatids into opposite halves of the cell during anaphase. Condensin is required to organize mitotic chromosomes into coherent structures that prevent them from getting tangled up during segregation. Here we describe the discovery of SMC complexes and discuss recent advances in determining how members of this ancient protein family may function at a mechanistic level.},

@article{Auzat1994,
abstract = {During the reaction catalyzed by the phosphofructokinase (EC 2.7.1.11) from Escherichia coli, the phosphoryl group transferred from ATP interacts with Thr-125 [Shirakihara, Y. {\&} Evans, P. R. (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 204, 973-994]. The replacement of Thr-125 by serine changes the saturation by fructose 6-phosphate from cooperative to hyperbolic and abolishes the allosteric inhibition by phosphoenolpyruvate. The same changes, a saturation by fructose 6-phosphate that is no longer cooperative and an activity that is no longer inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate, are observed with wild-type phosphofructokinase when adenosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate is used instead of ATP as the phosphoryl donor. These two perturbations of the ATP-Thr-125 interaction lead to the suppression of both the allosteric inhibition by phosphoenolpyruvate and the cooperativity of fructose-6-phosphate saturation, as if replacing the neutral oxygen of ATP by sulfur or removing the methyl group of Thr-125 had "locked" phosphofructokinase in its active conformation. The geometry of this ATP-Thr-125 interaction and/or the presence of the methyl group on the beta-carbon of Thr-125 are crucial for the regulatory properties of phosphofructokinase. This interaction could be a hydrogen bond between the neutral oxygen of the gamma-phosphate of ATP and the hydroxyl group of Thr-125.},

Using surface-bound DNA and a transcription reaction, we investigate the conditions for boundary-free compartmentalization. The DNA self-organizes into a dense and ordered phase with coding sequences aligned at well-defined distances and orientation relative to the surface, imposing directionality on transcription. Unique to the surface in comparison to dilute homogeneous DNA solution, the reaction slows down early, is inhibited with increased DNA density, is favorable for surface-oriented promoters, and is robust against DNA condensation. We interpret these results to suggest that macromolecules (RNA polymerase and RNA), but not solutes (ions and nucleotides), are partitioned between immobilized DNA and the reservoir. Without any physical barrier, a nonequilibrium directional DNA transaction forms macromolecular gradients that define a compartment, thus offering a boundary-free approach to the assembly of a synthetic cell.},

Although the three-dimensional (3D) structures of many enzyme-ligand complexes are available, it is still difficult to rationally engineer an allosterically regulatable enzyme without decreasing its catalytic activity. Here, we describe an effective strategy to deregulate the allosteric inhibition of enzymes based on the molecular evolution and physicochemical characteristics of allosteric ligand-binding sites. We found that allosteric sites are evolutionarily variable and comprised of more hydrophobic residues than catalytic sites. We applied our findings to design mutations in selected target residues that deregulate the allosteric activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase). Specifically, charged amino acids at less conserved positions were substituted with hydrophobic or neutral amino acids with similar sizes. The engineered proteins successfully diminished the allosteric inhibition of E. coli FBPase without affecting its catalytic efficiency. We expect that our method will aid the rational design of enzyme allosteric regulation strategies and facilitate the control of metabolic flux.},

SulA prevented the formation of high-molecular-weight FtsZ polymers by interfering with FtsZ dimerization and subsequent oligomerization. In contrast, the MinCD division inhibitor did not prevent the oligomerization of FtsZ in the cell extracts or the formation of FtsZ and ZipA ring structures in vivo. However, MinCD did prevent the formation of FtsA rings. Increased expression of ftsA suppressed MinCD-induced division inhibition, but had no effect on SulA-induced division inhibition. These results indicate that MinCD blocks the assembly of the septation machinery at a later step than SulA, at the stage at which FtsA is added to the FtsZ ring.},

abstract = {Different proteins have different expression levels. It is unclear to what extent these expression levels are optimized to their environment. Evolutionary theories suggest that protein expression levels maximize fitness, but the fitness as a function of protein level has seldom been directly measured. To address this, we studied the lac system of Escherichia coli, which allows the cell to use the sugar lactose for growth. We experimentally measured the growth burden due to production and maintenance of the Lac proteins (cost), as well as the growth advantage (benefit) conferred by the Lac proteins when lactose is present. The fitness function, given by the difference between the benefit and the cost, predicts that for each lactose environment there exists an optimal Lac expression level that maximizes growth rate. We then performed serial dilution evolution experiments at different lactose concentrations. In a few hundred generations, cells evolved to reach the predicted optimal expression levels. Thus, protein expression from the lac operon seems to be a solution of a cost-benefit optimization problem, and can be rapidly tuned by evolution to function optimally in new environments.},

As a consequence, males (XO; ratio 0.5) and hermaphrodites (XX; ratio 1.0) possess different doses of X-linked genes. Here we demonstrate that C. elegans compensates for this disparity in gene dose by equalizing the levels of X-specific mRNA transcripts in the two sexes. Moreover, we show that mutations in three autosomal genes disrupt the process of dosage compensation. Reduction in the activity of either dpy-21, dpy-27, or dpy-28 results in the overexpression of X-specific genes, 2- to 3-fold above wild-type levels.},

@article{Martins2013,
abstract = {Cellular decision-making is driven by dynamic behaviours, such as the preparations for sunrise enabled by circadian rhythms and the choice of cell fates enabled by positive feedback. Such behaviours are often built upon ultrasensitive responses where a linear change in input generates a sigmoidal change in output. Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles are one means to generate ultrasensitivity. Using bioinformatics, we show that in vivo levels of kinases and phosphatases frequently exceed the levels of their corresponding substrates in budding yeast. This result is in contrast to the conditions often required by zero-order ultrasensitivity, perhaps the most well known means for how such cycles become ultrasensitive. We therefore introduce a mechanism to generate ultrasensitivity when numbers of enzymes are higher than numbers of substrates. Our model combines distributive and non-distributive actions of the enzymes with two-stage binding and concerted allosteric transitions of the substrate. We use analytical and numerical methods to calculate the Hill number of the response. For a substrate with [Formula: see text] phosphosites, we find an upper bound of the Hill number of [Formula: see text], and so even systems with a single phosphosite can be ultrasensitive. Two-stage binding, where an enzyme must first bind to a binding site on the substrate before it can access the substrate's phosphosites, allows the enzymes to sequester the substrate. Such sequestration combined with competition for each phosphosite provides an intuitive explanation for the sigmoidal shifts in levels of phosphorylated substrate. Additionally, we find cases for which the response is not monotonic, but shows instead a peak at intermediate levels of input. Given its generality, we expect the mechanism described by our model to often underlay decision-making circuits in eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {Bacteria often face complex environments. We asked how gene expression in complex conditions relates to expression in simpler conditions. To address this, we obtained accurate promoter activity dynamical measurements on 94 genes in E. coli in environments made up of all possible combinations of four nutrients and stresses. We find that the dynamics across conditions is well described by two principal component curves specific to each promoter. As a result, the promoter activity dynamics in a combination of conditions is a weighted average of the dynamics in each condition alone. The weights tend to sum up to approximately one. This weighted-average property, called linear superposition, allows predicting the promoter activity dynamics in a combination of conditions based on measurements of pairs of conditions. If these findings apply more generally, they can vastly reduce the number of experiments needed to understand how E. coli responds to the combinatorially huge space of possible environments.},

However, a few studies have also reported Tyr phosphorylation in plants, but the relative contribution of tyrosine phosphorylation to plant signal transduction has remained an open question. We present an approach to selectively measure and quantify Tyr phosphorylation in plant cells, which can also be applied to whole plants. We combined a (15)N stable isotope metabolic labeling strategy with an immuno-affinity purification using phospho-tyrosine (pY) specific antibodies. This single enrichment strategy was sufficient to reproducibly identify and quantify pY containing peptides from total plant cell extract in a single LC-MS/MS run. We succeeded in identifying 149 unique pY peptides originating from 135 proteins, including a large set of different protein kinases and several receptor-like kinases. We used flagellin perception by Arabidopsis cells, a model system for pathogen triggered immune (PTI) signaling, to test our approach. We reproducibly quantified 23 pY peptides in 2 inversely labeled biological replicates identifying 11 differentially phosphorylated proteins. These include a set of 3 well-characterized flagellin responsive MAP kinases and 4 novel MAP kinases. With this targeted approach, we elucidate a new level of complexity in flagellin-induced MAP kinase activation.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cells extend pseudopodia for movement. In the absence of external cues, cells move in random directions, but with a strong element of persistence that keeps them moving in the same direction Persistence allows cells to disperse over larger areas and is instrumental to enter new environments where spatial cues can lead the cell. Here we explore cell movement by analyzing the direction, size and timing of approximately 2000 pseudopodia that are extended by Dictyostelium cells. The results show that pseudpopod are extended perpendicular to the surface curvature at the place where they emerge. The location of new pseudopods is not random but highly ordered. Two types of pseudopodia may be formed: frequent splitting of an existing pseudopod, or the occasional extension of a de novo pseudopod at regions devoid of recent pseudopod activity. Split-pseudopodia are extended at approximately 60 degrees relative to the previous pseudopod, mostly as alternating Right/Left/Right steps leading to relatively straight zigzag runs. De novo pseudopodia are extended in nearly random directions thereby interrupting the zigzag runs. Persistence of cell movement is based on the ratio of split versus de novo pseudopodia. We identify PLA2 and cGMP signaling pathways that modulate this ratio of splitting and de novo pseudopodia, and thereby regulate the dispersal of cells. The observed ordered extension of pseudopodia in the absence of external cues provides a fundamental insight into the coordinated movement of cells, and might form the basis for movement that is directed by internal or external cues.},

@article{Erickson2007,
abstract = {In the textbook view, the ratio of X chromosomes to autosome sets, X:A, is the primary signal specifying sexual fate in Drosophila. An alternative idea is that X chromosome number signals sex through the direct actions of several X-encoded signal element (XSE) proteins. In this alternative, the influence of autosome dose on X chromosome counting is largely indirect. Haploids (1X;1A), which possess the male number of X chromosomes but the female X:A of 1.0, and triploid intersexes (XX;AAA), which possess a female dose of two X chromosomes and the ambiguous X:A ratio of 0.67, represent critical tests of these hypotheses. To directly address the effects of ploidy in primary sex determination, we compared the responses of the signal target, the female-specific SxlPe promoter of the switch gene Sex-lethal, in haploid, diploid, and triploid embryos. We found that haploids activate SxlPe because an extra precellular nuclear division elevates total X chromosome numbers and XSE levels beyond those in diploid males. Conversely, triploid embryos cellularize one cycle earlier than diploids, causing premature cessation of SxlPe expression. This prevents XX;AAA embryos from fully engaging the autoregulatory mechanism that maintains subsequent Sxl expression, causing them to develop as sexual mosaics. We conclude that the X:A ratio predicts sexual fate, but does not actively specify it. Instead, the instructive X chromosome signal is more appropriately seen as collective XSE dose in the early embryo. Our findings reiterate that correlations between X:A ratios and cell fates in other organisms need not implicate the value of the ratio as an active signal.},

abstract = {Nutrient availability is one of the strongest determinants of cell size. When grown in rich media, single-celled organisms such as yeast and bacteria can be up to twice the size of their slow-growing counterparts. The ability to modulate size in a nutrient-dependent manner requires cells to: (1) detect when they have reached the appropriate mass for a given growth rate and (2) transmit this information to the division apparatus. We report the identification of a metabolic sensor that couples nutritional availability to division in Bacillus subtilis. A key component of this sensor is an effector, UgtP, which localizes to the division site in??a nutrient-dependent manner and inhibits assembly of the tubulin-like cell division protein FtsZ. This sensor serves to maintain a constant ratio of FtsZ rings to cell length regardless of growth rate and ensures that cells reach the appropriate mass and complete chromosome segregation prior to cytokinesis. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Charvin2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Imaging single cells with fluorescent markers over multiple cell cycles is a powerful tool for unraveling the mechanism and dynamics of the cell cycle. Over the past ten years, microfluidic techniques in cell biology have emerged that allow for good control of growth environment. Yet the control and quantification of transient gene expression in unperturbed dividing cells has received less attention. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we describe a microfluidic flow cell to grow Saccharomyces Cerevisiae for more than 8 generations (approximately 12 hrs) starting with single cells, with controlled flow of the growth medium. This setup provides two important features: first, cells are tightly confined and grow in a remarkably planar array. The pedigree can thus be determined and single-cell fluorescence measured with 3 minutes resolution for all cells, as a founder cell grows to a micro-colony of more than 200 cells. Second, we can trigger and calibrate rapid and transient gene expression using reversible administration of inducers that control the GAL1 or MET3 promoters. We then show that periodic 10-20 minutes gene induction pulses can drive many cell division cycles with complete coherence across the cell cluster, with either a G1/S trigger (cln1 cln2 cln3 MET3-CLN2) or a mitotic trigger (cdc20 GALL-CDC20). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In addition to evident cell cycle applications, this device can be used to directly measure the amount and duration of any fluorescently scorable signal-transduction or gene-induction response over a long time period. The system allows direct correlation of cell history (e.g., hysteresis or epigenetics) or cell cycle position with the measured response.},

abstract = {The N-end rule states that the half-life of a protein is determined by the nature of its N-terminal residue. This fundamental principle of regulated proteolysis is conserved from bacteria to mammals. Although prokaryotes and eukaryotes employ distinct proteolytic machineries for degradation of N-end rule substrates, recent findings indicate that they share common principles of substrate recognition. In eukaryotes substrate recognition is mediated by N-recognins, a class of E3 ligases that labels N-end rule substrates via covalent linkage to ubiquitin, allowing the subsequent substrate delivery to the 26S proteasome. In bacteria, the adaptor protein ClpS exhibits homology to the substrate binding site of N-recognin. ClpS binds to the destabilizing N-termini of N-end rule substrates and directly transfers them to the ClpAP protease.},

Here, we undertake to make this intuition rigorous and quantitative by deriving a lower bound for the amount of heat that is produced during a process of self-replication in a system coupled to a thermal bath. We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of heat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and durability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding for bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of self-replicating nucleic acids.},

abstract = {Diverse cell polarity networks require positive feedback for locally amplifying distributions of signalling molecules at the plasma membrane. Additional mechanisms, such as directed transport or coupled inhibitors, have been proposed to be required for reinforcing a unique axis of polarity. Here we analyse a simple model of positive feedback, with strong analogy to the 'stepping stone' model of population genetics, in which a single species of diffusible, membrane-bound signalling molecules can self-recruit from a cytoplasmic pool. We identify an intrinsic stochastic mechanism through which positive feedback alone is sufficient to account for the spontaneous establishment of a single site of polarity. We find that the polarization frequency has an inverse dependence on the number of signalling molecules: the frequency of polarization decreases as the number of molecules becomes large. Experimental observation of polarizing Cdc42 in budding yeast is consistent with this prediction. Our work suggests that positive feedback can work alone or with additional mechanisms to create robust cell polarity.},

Even though advances in high-throughput data generation have transformed biology, the core of our biological understanding, and hence data interpretation, is still predicated on human-defined pathways. Here, we introduce an unbiased, pathway structure for genome-scale metabolic networks defined based on principles of parsimony that do not mimic canonical human-defined textbook pathways. Instead, these minimal pathways better describe multiple independent pathway-associated biomolecular interaction datasets suggesting a functional organization for metabolism based on parsimonious use of cellular components. We use the inherent predictive capability of these pathways to experimentally discover novel transcriptional regulatory interactions in Escherichia coli metabolism for three transcription factors, effectively doubling the known regulatory roles for Nac and MntR. This study suggests an underlying and fundamental principle in the evolutionary selection of pathway structures; namely, that pathways may be minimal, independent, and segregated.},

@article{Jamet2015,
abstract = {Bacteria have evolved numerous strategies to increase their competitiveness and fight against each other. Indeed, a large arsenal of antibacterial weapons is available in order to inhibit the proliferation of competitor cells. Polymorphic toxin systems (PTS), recently identified by bioinformatics in all major bacterial lineages, correspond to such a system primarily involved in conflict between related bacterial strains. They are typically composed of a secreted multidomain toxin, a protective immunity protein, and multiple cassettes encoding alternative toxic domains. The C-terminal domains of polymorphic toxins carry the toxic activity, whereas the N-terminal domains are related to the trafficking mode. In silico analysis of PTS identified over 150 distinct toxin domains, including putative nuclease, deaminase, or peptidase domains. Immunity genes found immediately downstream of the toxin genes encode small proteins that protect bacteria against their own toxins or against toxins secreted by neighboring cells. PTS encompass well-known colicins and pyocins, contact-dependent growth inhibition systems which include CdiA and Rhs toxins and some effectors of type VI secretion systems. We have recently characterized the MafB toxins, a new family of PTS deployed by pathogenic Neisseria spp. Many other putative PTS have been identified by in silico predictions but have yet to be characterized experimentally. However, the high number of these systems suggests that PTS have a fundamental role in bacterial biology that is likely to extend beyond interbacterial competition.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the rate and nature of spontaneous mutation is fundamental to understanding evolutionary and molecular processes. In this report, we analyze spontaneous mutations accumulated over thousands of generations by wild-type Escherichia coli and a derivative defective in mismatch repair (MMR), the primary pathway for correcting replication errors. The major conclusions are (i) the mutation rate of a wild-type E. coli strain is {\~{}}1 Ã 10(-3) per genome per generation; (ii) mutations in the wild-type strain have the expected mutational bias for G:C {\textgreater} A:T mutations, but the bias changes to A:T {\textgreater} G:C mutations in the absence of MMR; (iii) during replication, A:T {\textgreater} G:C transitions preferentially occur with A templating the lagging strand and T templating the leading strand, whereas G:C {\textgreater} A:T transitions preferentially occur with C templating the lagging strand and G templating the leading strand; (iv) there is a strong bias for transition mutations to occur at 5'ApC3'/3'TpG5' sites (where bases 5'A and 3'T are mutated) and, to a lesser extent, at 5'GpC3'/3'CpG5' sites (where bases 5'G and 3'C are mutated); (v) although the rate of small (â¤4 nt) insertions and deletions is high at repeat sequences, these events occur at only 1/10th the genomic rate of base-pair substitutions. MMR activity is genetically regulated, and bacteria isolated from nature often lack MMR capacity, suggesting that modulation of MMR can be adaptive. Thus, comparing results from the wild-type and MMR-defective strains may lead to a deeper understanding of factors that determine mutation rates and spectra, how these factors may differ among organisms, and how they may be shaped by environmental conditions.},

abstract = {In eukaryotes, DNA replication is coupled to the cell cycle through the actions of cyclin-dependent kinases and associated factors. In bacteria, the prevailing view, based primarily from work in Escherichia coli, is that growth-dependent accumulation of the highly conserved initiator, DnaA, triggers initiation. However, the timing of initiation is unchanged in Bacillus subtilis mutants that are {\~{}}30{\%} smaller than wild-type cells, indicating that achievement of a particular cell size is not obligatory for initiation. Prompted by this finding, we re-examined the link between cell size and initiation in both E. coli and B. subtilis. Although changes in DNA replication have been shown to alter both E. coli and B. subtilis cell size, the converse (the effect of cell size on DNA replication) has not been explored. Here, we report that the mechanisms responsible for coordinating DNA replication with cell size vary between these two model organisms. In contrast to B. subtilis, small E. coli mutants delayed replication initiation until they achieved the size at which wild-type cells initiate. Modest increases in DnaA alleviated the delay, supporting the view that growth-dependent accumulation of DnaA is the trigger for replication initiation in E. coli. Significantly, although small E. coli and B. subtilis cells both maintained wild-type concentration of DnaA, only the E. coli mutants failed to initiate on time. Thus, rather than the concentration, the total amount of DnaA appears to be more important for initiation timing in E. coli. The difference in behavior of the two bacteria appears to lie in the mechanisms that control the activity of DnaA.},

abstract = {The trafficking, membrane localization, and lipid raft association of Ras proteins, which are crucial oncogenic mediators, dictate their isoform-specific biological responses. Accordingly, their spatiotemporal dynamics are tightly regulated. While extensively studied for H- and K-Ras, such information on N-Ras, an etiological oncogenic factor, is limited. Here, we report a novel mechanism regulating the activation-dependent spatiotemporal organization of N-Ras, its modulation by biologically relevant stimuli, and isoform-specific effects on signaling. We combined patching/immobilization of another membrane protein with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (patch-FRAP) and FRAP beam size analysis to investigate N-Ras membrane interactions. Clustering of raft-associated proteins, either glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA-GPI) or fibronectin receptors, selectively enhanced the plasma membrane-cytoplasm exchange of N-Ras-GTP (preferentially associated with raft domains) in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Electron microscopy (EM) analysis showed N-Ras-GTP localization in cholesterol-sensitive clusters, from which it preferentially detached upon HA-GPI cross-linking. HA-GPI clustering enhanced the Golgi compartment (GC) accumulation and signaling of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated N-Ras-GTP. Notably, the cross-linking-mediated enhancement of N-Ras-GTP exchange and GC accumulation depended strictly on depalmitoylation. We propose that the N-Ras activation pattern (e.g., by EGF) is altered by raft protein clustering, which enhances N-Ras-GTP raft localization and depalmitoylation, entailing its exchange and GC accumulation following repalmitoylation. This mechanism demonstrates a functional signaling role for the activation-dependent differential association of Ras isoforms with raft nanodomains.},

abstract = {In the last decade evidence has accumulated that small domains of 50-700 nm in diameter are located in the exoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. Most of these domains supposedly consist of specific sets of lipids and proteins, and are believed to coordinate signal transduction cascades. Whether similar domains are also present in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane is unclear so far. To investigate the presence of cytoplasmic leaflet domains, the H-Ras membrane-targeting sequence was fused to the C-terminus of the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein. Using single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, trajectories of individual molecules diffusing in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane were recorded. From these trajectories, the diffusion of individual membrane-anchored enhanced yellow fluorescent protein molecules was studied in live cells on timescales from 5 to 200 ms. The results show that the diffusion of 30-40{\%} of the molecules is constrained in domains with a typical size of 200 nm. Neither breakdown of actin nor cholesterol extraction changed the domain characteristics significantly, indicating that the observed domains may not be related to the membrane domains identified so far.},

abstract = {Mechanical responsiveness is essential to all biological systems down to the level of tissues and cells. The intra- and extracellular mechanics of such systems are governed by a series of proteins, such as microtubules, actin, intermediate filaments and collagen. As a general design motif, these proteins self-assemble into helical structures and superstructures that differ in diameter and persistence length to cover the full mechanical spectrum. Gels of cytoskeletal proteins display particular mechanical responses (stress stiffening) that until now have been absent in synthetic polymeric and low-molar-mass gels. Here we present synthetic gels that mimic in nearly all aspects gels prepared from intermediate filaments. They are prepared from polyisocyanopeptides grafted with oligo(ethylene glycol) side chains. These responsive polymers possess a stiff and helical architecture, and show a tunable thermal transition where the chains bundle together to generate transparent gels at extremely low concentrations. Using characterization techniques operating at different length scales (for example, macroscopic rheology, atomic force microscopy and molecular force spectroscopy) combined with an appropriate theoretical network model, we establish the hierarchical relationship between the bulk mechanical properties and the single-molecule parameters. Our results show that to develop artificial cytoskeletal or extracellular matrix mimics, the essential design parameters are not only the molecular stiffness, but also the extent of bundling. In contrast to the peptidic materials, our polyisocyanide polymers are readily modified, giving a starting point for functional biomimetic hydrogels with potentially a wide variety of applications, in particular in the biomedical field.},

abstract = {Recent studies show that the partitioning of the small GTPase H-Ras in different types of membrane microdomains is dependent on guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-loading of H-Ras. Detailed knowledge about the in vivo dynamics of this phenomenon is limited. In this report, the effect of the activation of H-Ras on its microdomain localization was studied by single-molecule fluorescence microscopy. Individual human H-Ras molecules fused to the enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) were imaged in the dorsal plasma membrane of live mouse cells and their diffusion behavior was analyzed. The diffusion of a constitutively inactive (S17N) and constitutively active (G12V) mutant of H-Ras was compared. Detailed analysis revealed that for both mutants a major, fast-diffusing population and a minor, slow-diffusing population were present. The slow-diffusing fraction of the active mutant was confined to 200 nm domains, which were not observed for the inactive mutant. In line with these results we observed that the slow-diffusing fraction of wild-type H-Ras became confined to 200 nm domains upon insulin-induced activation of wild-type H-Ras. This activation-dependent localization of H-Ras to 200 nm domains, for the first time directly detected in live cells, supports the proposed relationship between H-Ras microdomain localization and activation.},

abstract = {The cAMP receptor protein (CRP) of Escherichia coli undergoes a conformational change in response to cAMP binding that allows it to bind specific DNA sequences. Using an in vivo screening method following the simultaneous randomization of the codons at positions 127 and 128 (two C-helix residues of the protein interacting with cAMP), we have isolated a series of novel constitutively active CRP variants. Sequence analysis showed that this group of variants commonly possesses leucine or methionine at position 127 with a beta-branched amino acid at position 128. One specific variant, T127L/S128I CRP, showed extremely high cAMP-independent DNA binding affinity comparable with that of cAMP-bound wild-type CRP. Further biochemical analysis of this variant and others revealed that Leu(127) and Ile(128) have different roles in stabilizing the active conformation of CRP in the absence of cAMP. Leu(127) contributes to an improved leucine zipper at the dimer interface, leading to an altered intersubunit interaction in the C-helix region. In contrast, Ile(128) stabilizes the proper position of the beta4/beta5 loop by functionally communicating with Leu(61). By analogy, the results suggest two direct local effects of cAMP binding in the course of activating wild-type CRP: (i) C-helix repositioning through direct interaction with Thr(127) and Ser(128) and (ii) the concomitant reorientation of the beta4/beta5 loop. Finally, we also report that elevated expression of T127L/S128I CRP markedly perturbed E. coli growth even in the absence of cAMP, which suggests why comparably active variants have not been described previously.},

abstract = {Gene expression is regulated by specific transcriptional circuits but also by the global expression machinery as a function of growth. Simultaneous specific and global regulation thus constitutes an additional--but often neglected--layer of complexity in gene expression. Here, we develop an experimental-computational approach to dissect specific and global regulation in the bacterium Escherichia coli. By using fluorescent promoter reporters, we show that global regulation is growth rate dependent not only during steady state but also during dynamic changes in growth rate and can be quantified through two promoter-specific parameters. By applying our approach to arginine biosynthesis, we obtain a quantitative understanding of both specific and global regulation that allows accurate prediction of the temporal response to simultaneous perturbations in arginine availability and growth rate. We thereby uncover two principles of joint regulation: (i) specific regulation by repression dominates the transcriptional response during metabolic steady states, largely repressing the biosynthesis genes even when biosynthesis is required and (ii) global regulation sets the maximum promoter activity that is exploited during the transition between steady states.},

abstract = {Growth rate and nutrient availability are the primary determinants of size in single-celled organisms: rapidly growing Escherichia coli cells are more than twice as large as their slow growing counterparts. Here we report the identification of the glucosyltransferase OpgH as a nutrient-dependent regulator of E. coli cell size. During growth under nutrient-rich conditions, OpgH localizes to the nascent septal site, where it antagonizes assembly of the tubulin-like cell division protein FtsZ, delaying division and increasing cell size. Biochemical analysis is consistent with OpgH sequestering FtsZ from growing polymers. OpgH is functionally analogous to UgtP, a Bacillus subtilis glucosyltransferase that inhibits cell division in a growth rate-dependent fashion. In a striking example of convergent evolution, OpgH and UgtP share no homology, have distinct enzymatic activities, and appear to inhibit FtsZ assembly through different mechanisms. Comparative analysis of E. coli and B. subtilis reveals conserved aspects of growth rate regulation and cell size control that are likely to be broadly applicable. These include the conservation of uridine diphosphate glucose as a proxy for nutrient status and the use of moonlighting enzymes to couple growth rate-dependent phenomena to central metabolism.},

abstract = {Fluctuations in the abundance of molecules in the living cell may affect its growth and well being. For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or transcription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels of downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to investigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks. Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly interlinked, and noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the exactly soluble linear queuing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently, fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely shared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study metabolic networks with more complex topologies or protein signaling networks that are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for bioinformatic analysis of metabolomic data are discussed.},

abstract = {Methylation of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is implemented by Set1/COMPASS, which was originally purified based on the similarity of yeast Set1 to human MLL1 and Drosophila melanogaster Trithorax (Trx). While humans have six COMPASS family members, Drosophila possesses a representative of the three subclasses within COMPASS-like complexes: dSet1 (human SET1A/SET1B), Trx (human MLL1/2), and Trr (human MLL3/4). Here, we report the biochemical purification and molecular characterization of the Drosophila COMPASS family. We observed a one-to-one similarity in subunit composition with their mammalian counterparts, with the exception of LPT (lost plant homeodomains [PHDs] of Trr), which copurifies with the Trr complex. LPT is a previously uncharacterized protein that is homologous to the multiple PHD fingers found in the N-terminal regions of mammalian MLL3/4 but not Drosophila Trr, indicating that Trr and LPT constitute a split gene of an MLL3/4 ancestor. Our study demonstrates that all three complexes in Drosophila are H3K4 methyltransferases; however, dSet1/COMPASS is the major monoubiquitination-dependent H3K4 di- and trimethylase in Drosophila. Taken together, this study provides a springboard for the functional dissection of the COMPASS family members and their role in the regulation of histone H3K4 methylation throughout development in Drosophila.},

abstract = {Central functions in the cell are often linked to complex dynamic behaviours, such as sustained oscillations and multistability, in a biochemical reaction network. Determination of the specific mechanisms underlying such behaviours is important, e.g. to determine sensitivity, robustness, and modelling requirements of given cell functions. In this work we adopt a systems approach to the analysis of complex behaviours in intracellular reaction networks, described by ordinary differential equations with known kinetic parameters. We propose to decompose the overall system into a number of low complexity subsystems, and consider the importance of interactions between these in generating specific behaviours. Rather than analysing the network in a state corresponding to the complex non-linear behaviour, we move the system to the underlying unstable steady state, and focus on the mechanisms causing destabilisation of this steady state. This is motivated by the fact that all complex behaviours in unforced systems can be traced to destabilisation (bifurcation) of some steady state, and hence enables us to use tools from linear system theory to qualitatively analyse the sources of given network behaviours. One important objective of the present study is to see how far one can come with a relatively simple approach to the analysis of highly complex biochemical networks. The proposed method is demonstrated by application to a model of mitotic control in Xenopus frog eggs, and to a model of circadian oscillations in Drosophila. In both examples we are able to identify the subsystems, and the related interactions, which are instrumental in generating the observed complex non-linear behaviours.},

abstract = {In response to environmental changes, the connections ("arrows") in gene regulatory networks determine which genes modulate their expression, but the quantitative parameters of the network ("the numbers on the arrows") are equally important in determining the resulting phenotype. What are the objectives and constraints by which evolution determines these parameters? We explore these issues by analyzing gene expression changes in a number of yeast metabolic pathways in response to nutrient depletion. We find that a striking pattern emerges that couples the regulatory architecture of the pathway to the gene expression response. In particular, we find that pathways controlled by the intermediate metabolite activation (IMA) architecture, in which an intermediate metabolite activates transcription of pathway genes, exhibit the following response: the enzyme immediately downstream of the regulatory metabolite is under the strongest transcriptional control, whereas the induction of the enzymes upstream of the regulatory intermediate is relatively weak. This pattern of responses is absent in pathways not controlled by an IMA architecture. The observation can be explained by the constraint imposed by the fundamental feedback structure of the network, which places downstream enzymes under a negative feedback loop and upstream ones under a positive feedback loop. This general design principle for transcriptional control of a metabolic pathway can be derived from a simple cost/benefit model of gene expression, in which the observed pattern is an optimal solution. Our results suggest that the parameters regulating metabolic enzyme expression are optimized by evolution, under the strong constraint of the underlying regulatory architecture.},

abstract = {It is now well appreciated that bacterial cells are highly organized, which is far from the initial concept that they are merely bags of randomly distributed macromolecules and chemicals. Central to their spatial organization is the precise positioning of certain proteins in subcellular domains of the cell. In particular, the cell poles - the ends of rod-shaped cells - constitute important platforms for cellular regulation that underlie processes as essential as cell cycle progression, cellular differentiation, virulence, chemotaxis and growth of appendages. Thus, understanding how the polar localization of specific proteins is achieved and regulated is a crucial question in bacterial cell biology. Often, polarly localized proteins are recruited to the poles through their interaction with other proteins or protein complexes that were already located there, in a so-called diffusion-and-capture mechanism. Bacteria are also starting to reveal their secrets on how the initial pole 'recognition' can occur and how this event can be regulated to generate dynamic, reproducible patterns in time (for example, during the cell cycle) and space (for example, at a specific cell pole). Here, we review the major mechanisms that have been described in the literature, with an emphasis on the self-organizing principles. We also present regulation strategies adopted by bacterial cells to obtain complex spatiotemporal patterns of protein localization.},

In both systems, a wealth of new structural and molecular details has emerged recently. In light of this, we explore similarities between chaperone/usher and sortase-assembled pilus biogenesis and highlight paradigms unique to each, with the goal of using knowledge of each system to raise new questions and inform future studies of the other.},

abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity is a hallmark of living systems, even at the molecular scale in individual cells. A key example is the partitioning of membrane-bound proteins via lipid domain formation or cytoskeleton-induced corralling. However, the impact of this spatial heterogeneity on biochemical signaling processes is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that partitioning improves the reliability of biochemical signaling. We exactly solve a stochastic model describing a ubiquitous motif in membrane signaling. The solution reveals that partitioning improves signaling reliability via two effects: it moderates the nonlinearity of the switching response, and it reduces noise in the response by suppressing correlations between molecules. An optimal partition size arises from a trade-off between minimizing the number of proteins per partition to improve signaling reliability and ensuring sufficient proteins per partition to maintain signal propagation. The predicted optimal partition size agrees quantitatively with experimentally observed systems. These results persist in spatial simulations with explicit diffusion barriers. Our findings suggest that molecular partitioning is not merely a consequence of the complexity of cellular substructures, but also plays an important functional role in cell signaling.},

abstract = {Cells need to allocate their limited resources to express a wide range of genes. To understand how Escherichia coli partitions its transcriptional resources between its different promoters, we employ a robotic assay using a comprehensive reporter strain library for E. coli to measure promoter activity on a genomic scale at high-temporal resolution and accuracy. This allows continuous tracking of promoter activity as cells change their growth rate from exponential to stationary phase in different media. We find a heavy-tailed distribution of promoter activities, with promoter activities spanning several orders of magnitude. While the shape of the distribution is almost completely independent of the growth conditions, the identity of the promoters expressed at different levels does depend on them. Translation machinery genes, however, keep the same relative expression levels in the distribution across conditions, and their fractional promoter activity tracks growth rate tightly. We present a simple optimization model for resource allocation which suggests that the observed invariant distributions might maximize growth rate. These invariant features of the distribution of promoter activities may suggest design constraints that shape the allocation of transcriptional resources.},

abstract = {Exponentially growing bacteria are rarely found in the wild, as microorganisms tend to spend most of their lifetime at stationary phase. Despite this general prevalence of stationary-phase bacteria, they are as yet poorly characterized. Our goal was to quantitatively study this phase by direct observation of single bacteria as they enter into stationary phase and by monitoring their activity over several days during growth arrest. For this purpose, we devised an experimental procedure for starving single Escherichia coli bacteria in microfluidic devices and measured their activity by monitoring the production rate of fluorescent proteins. When amino acids were the sole carbon source, the production rate decreased by an order of magnitude upon entry into stationary phase. We found that, even while growth-arrested, bacteria continued to produce proteins at a surprisingly constant rate over several days. Our identification of this newly observed period of constant activity in nongrowing cells, designated as constant activity stationary phase, makes possible the conduction of assays that require constant protein expression over time, and are therefore difficult to perform under exponential growth conditions. Moreover, we show that exogenous protein expression bears no fitness cost on the regrowth of the population when starvation ends. Further characterization of constant activity stationary phase-a phase where nongrowing bacteria can be quantitatively studied over several days in a reproducible manner-should contribute to a better understanding of this ubiquitous but overlooked physiological state of bacteria in nature.},

We have isolated hybrid tetramers containing one wild type subunit and three mutated subunits (1:3). The mutated subunits contain mutations that decrease affinity for Fru-6-P (R243E) or MgATP (F76A/R77D/R82A) allowing us to systematically simplify the possible allosteric interactions between the two substrates. In the absence of a rate equation to explain the allosteric effects in a tetramer, the data have been compared to simulated data for an allosteric dimer. Since the apparent substrate inhibition caused by MgATP binding is not seen in hybrid tetramers with only a single native MgATP binding site, the proposed kinetic mechanism is not able to explain this phenomenon. The data presented are consistent with an allosteric antagonism between MgATP in one active site and Fru-6-P in a second active site.},

abstract = {DNA cruciforms play an important role in the regulation of natural processes involving DNA. These structures are formed by inverted repeats, and their stability is enhanced by DNA supercoiling. Cruciform structures are fundamentally important for a wide range of biological processes, including replication, regulation of gene expression, nucleosome structure and recombination. They also have been implicated in the evolution and development of diseases including cancer, Werner's syndrome and others.Cruciform structures are targets for many architectural and regulatory proteins, such as histones H1 and H5, topoisomerase II$\beta$, HMG proteins, HU, p53, the proto-oncogene protein DEK and others. A number of DNA-binding proteins, such as the HMGB-box family members, Rad54, BRCA1 protein, as well as PARP-1 polymerase, possess weak sequence specific DNA binding yet bind preferentially to cruciform structures. Some of these proteins are, in fact, capable of inducing the formation of cruciform structures upon DNA binding. In this article, we review the protein families that are involved in interacting with and regulating cruciform structures, including (a) the junction-resolving enzymes, (b) DNA repair proteins and transcription factors, (c) proteins involved in replication and (d) chromatin-associated proteins. The prevalence of cruciform structures and their roles in protein interactions, epigenetic regulation and the maintenance of cell homeostasis are also discussed.},

abstract = {E. coli is widely used for systems biology research; there exists a need, however, for tools that can be used to accurately and comprehensively measure expression dynamics in individual living cells. To address this we present a library of transcriptional fusions of gfp to each of about 2,000 different promoters in E. coli K12, covering the great majority of the promoters in the organism. Each promoter fusion is expressed from a low-copy plasmid. We demonstrate that this library can be used to obtain highly accurate dynamic measurements of promoter activity on a genomic scale, in a glucose-lactose diauxic shift experiment. The library allowed detection of about 80 previously uncharacterized transcription units in E. coli, including putative internal promoters within previously known operons, such as the lac operon. This library can serve as a tool for accurate, high-resolution analysis of transcription networks in living E. coli cells.},

abstract = {One fundamental shortcoming of biotechnological processes operating under carbon-limiting conditions is the high-energy demand (maintenance) of the cells. Although the function of the central carbon metabolism in supplying precursors and energy for biosynthesis has been thoroughly characterized, its regulation and dynamic behaviour during carbon-limited growth has not yet been revealed. The current work demonstrates a time series of metabolic flux distributions during fed-batch cultivation of Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 applying a constant feed rate. The fluxes in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway and biosynthesis fell significantly, whereas TCA cycle fluxes remained constant. The flux redistribution resulted in an enhanced energy generation in the TCA cycle and consequently, in a 20{\%} lower biomass yield. The intracellular alarmones ppGpp and cAMP accumulated in large quantities after the onset of nutrient limitation, subsequently declining to basal levels. The network topology of the regulation of the central metabolic pathways was identified so that the observed metabolic and regulatory behaviour can be described. This provides novel aspects of global regulation of the metabolism by the cra, crp and relA/spoT modulons. The work constitutes an important step towards dynamic mathematical modelling of regulation and metabolism, which is needed for the rational optimization of biotechnological processes.},

When exposed to cephalexin or carbenicillin at twice the minimum inhibitory concentration cell division was inhibited but growth in length proceeded at a uniform exponential rate until abruptly terminated by lysis. The rate of growth of such filamentous cells did not differ significantly from that of normal cells grown in the absence of antibiotic. In contrast, exposure to cephaloridine and amoxycillin at twice the minimum inhibitory concentration resulted in a marked diminution in the rate of cell growth, and lysis occurred very much sooner. At concentrations greatly in excess of the minimum inhibitory concentration (greater than 100-fold) cephalexin also resulted in a diminution in the rate of cell growth and this was accompanied by earlier lysis. The significance of these findings is discussed in relation to the mode of action of beta-lactam antibiotics.},

Given the difficulty to access the main sites of the gut, in vitro models have been developed to dynamically monitor microbial processes at the site of metabolic activity. These models range from simple batch fermentations to complex multi-compartmental continuous systems. The latter include different models, focussing on similar but each also on distinct digestive parameters. The most intensively used include the three-stage continuous culture system, SHIME({\textregistered}), EnteroMix, Lacroix model and TIM-2. Especially after inclusion of surface-attached mucosal microbes (M-SHIME), such models have been shown representative of the in vivo situation in terms of microbial composition and activity. They have even been shown to maintain the interpersonal variation among different human fecal inocula. Novel developments, such as the incorporation of host cells, will further broaden the potential of in vitro models to unravel the importance of gut microbes for human health and disease.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory networks lie at the heart of cellular computation. In these networks, intracellular and extracellular signals are integrated by transcription factors, which control the expression of transcription units by binding to cis-regulatory regions on the DNA. The designs of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cis-regulatory regions are usually highly complex. They frequently consist of both repetitive and overlapping transcription factor binding sites. To unravel the design principles of these promoter architectures, we have designed in silico prokaryotic transcriptional logic gates with predefined input-output relations using an evolutionary algorithm. The resulting cis-regulatory designs are often composed of modules that consist of tandem arrays of binding sites to which the transcription factors bind cooperatively. Moreover, these modules often overlap with each other, leading to competition between them. Our analysis thus identifies a new signal integration motif that is based upon the interplay between intramodular cooperativity and intermodular competition. We show that this signal integration mechanism drastically enhances the capacity of cis-regulatory domains to integrate signals. Our results provide a possible explanation for the complexity of promoter architectures and could be used for the rational design of synthetic gene circuits.},

By using the yeast galactose network as a model, we combinatorially deleted one of the two copies of its four regulatory genes and found that network activity was robust to the change in network dosage. A mathematical analysis revealed that a two-component genetic circuit with elements of opposite regulatory activity (activator and inhibitor) constitutes a minimal requirement for network-dosage invariance. Specific interaction topologies and a one-to-one interaction stoichiometry between the activating and inhibiting agents were additional essential elements facilitating dosage invariance. This mechanism of network-dosage invariance could represent a general design for gene network structure in cells.},

abstract = {In cellular regulatory networks, genetic activity is controlled by molecular signals that determine when and how often a given gene is transcribed. In genetically controlled pathways, the protein product encoded by one gene often regulates expression of other genes. The time delay, after activation of the first promoter, to reach an effective level to control the next promoter depends on the rate of protein accumulation. We have analyzed the chemical reactions controlling transcript initiation and translation termination in a single such "genetically coupled" link as a precursor to modeling networks constructed from many such links. Simulation of the processes of gene expression shows that proteins are produced from an activated promoter in short bursts of variable numbers of proteins that occur at random time intervals. As a result, there can be large differences in the time between successive events in regulatory cascades across a cell population. In addition, the random pattern of expression of competitive effectors can produce probabilistic outcomes in switching mechanisms that select between alternative regulatory paths. The result can be a partitioning of the cell population into different phenotypes as the cells follow different paths. There are numerous unexplained examples of phenotypic variations in isogenic populations of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may be the result of these stochastic gene expression mechanisms.},

@article{Jones2013,
abstract = {A number of studies have reported that pathogenic and nonpathogenic foodborne bacteria have the ability to form filaments in microbiological growth media and foods after prolonged exposure to sublethal stress or marginal growth conditions. In many cases, nucleoids are evenly spaced throughout the filamentous cells but septa are not visible, indicating that there is a blockage in the early steps of cell division but the mechanism behind filament formation is not clear. The formation of filamentous cells appears to be a reversible stress response. When filamentous cells are exposed to more favorable growth conditions, filaments divide rapidly into a number of individual cells, which may have major health and regulatory implications for the food industry because the potential numbers of viable bacteria will be underestimated and may exceed tolerated levels in foods when filamentous cells that are subjected to sublethal stress conditions are enumerated. Evidence suggests that filament formation under a number of sublethal stresses may be linked to a reduced energy state of bacterial cells. This review focuses on the conditions and extent of filament formation by foodborne bacteria under conditions that are used to control the growth of microorganisms in foods such as suboptimal pH, high pressure, low water activity, low temperature, elevated CO2 and exposure to antimicrobial substances as well as lack a of nutrients in the food environment and explores the impact of the sublethal stresses on the cell's inability to divide. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

After releasing the stretching force we observe a higher probability for enzymatic activity at a time of 1.7 s. A detailed theoretical analysis reveals that the relaxation from the force-induced enzyme conformation to the observed active conformation follows a cascade reaction with several steps and a free energy difference of at least 8 k(B)T. Our study clearly points out the direct influence of force on enzymatic activity and opens up a new way to study and manipulate (bio)catalytic reactions at the single molecule level.},

abstract = {How cells maintain their ploidy is relevant to cellular development and disease. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which the bacterium Bacillus subtilis enforces diploidy as it differentiates into a dormant spore. We demonstrate that a sporulation-induced protein SirA (originally annotated YneE) blocks new rounds of replication by targeting the highly conserved replication initiation factor DnaA. We show that SirA interacts with DnaA and displaces it from the replication origin. As a result, expression of SirA during growth rapidly blocks replication and causes cell death in a DnaA-dependent manner. Finally, cells lacking SirA over-replicate during sporulation. These results support a model in which induction of SirA enforces diploidy by inhibiting replication initiation as B. subtilis cells develop into spores.},

abstract = {To better understand the contributions that the structural maintenance of chromosome proteins (SMCs) make to condensin activity, we have tested a number of biochemical, biophysical, and DNA-associated attributes of the Smc2p-Smc4p pair from budding yeast. Smc2p and Smc4p form a stable heterodimer, the "Smc2/4 complex," which upon analysis by sedimentation equilibrium appears to reversibly self-associate to form heterotetramers. Individually, neither Smc2p nor Smc4p hydrolyzes ATP; however, ATPase activity is recovered by equal molar mixing of both purified proteins. Hydrolysis activity is unaffected by the presence of DNA. Smc2/4 binds both linearized and circular plasmids, and the binding appears to be independent of adenylate nucleotide. High mole ratios of Smc2/4 to plasmid promote a geometric change in circular DNA that can be trapped as knots by type II topoisomerases but not as supercoils by a type I topoisomerase. Binding titration analyses reveal that two Smc2/4-DNA-bound states exist, one disrupted by and one resistant to salt challenge. Competition-displacement experiments show that Smc2/4-DNA-bound species formed at even high protein to DNA mole ratios remain reversible. Surprisingly, only linear and supercoiled DNA, not nicked-circular DNA, can completely displace Smc2/4 prebound to a labeled, nicked-circular DNA. To explain this geometry-dependent competition, we present two models of DNA binding by SMCs in which two DNA duplexes are captured within the inter-coil space of an Smc2/4 heterodimer. Based on these models, we propose a DNA displacement mechanism to explain how differences in geometry could affect the competitive potential of DNA.},

By using the yeast galactose network as a model, we combinatorially deleted one of the two copies of its four regulatory genes and found that network activity was robust to the change in network dosage. A mathematical analysis revealed that a two-component genetic circuit with elements of opposite regulatory activity (activator and inhibitor) constitutes a minimal requirement for network-dosage invariance. Specific interaction topologies and a one-to-one interaction stoichiometry between the activating and inhibiting agents were additional essential elements facilitating dosage invariance. This mechanism of network-dosage invariance could represent a general design for gene network structure in cells.},

However, even genetically identical cells in identical environments display variable phenotypes. Stochastic gene expression, or gene expression "noise," has been suggested as a major source of this variability, and its physiological consequences have been topics of intense research for the last decade. Several recent studies have measured variability in protein and messenger RNA levels, and they have discovered strong connections between noise and gene regulation mechanisms. When integrated with discrete stochastic models, measurements of cell-to-cell variability provide a sensitive "fingerprint" with which to explore fundamental questions of gene regulation. In this review, we highlight several studies that used gene expression variability to develop a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of gene regulation.},

Subsequent condensation and bending of FtsZ filaments are important for the formation and constriction of the cytokinetic ring. PC190723 is an effective bactericidal cell division inhibitor that targets FtsZ in the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis and does not affect Escherichia coli cells, which apparently binds to a zone equivalent to the binding site of the antitumor drug taxol in tubulin (Haydon, D. J., Stokes, N. R., Ure, R., Galbraith, G., Bennett, J. M., Brown, D. R., Baker, P. J., Barynin, V. V., Rice, D. W., Sedelnikova, S. E., Heal, J. R., Sheridan, J. M., Aiwale, S. T., Chauhan, P. K., Srivastava, A., Taneja, A., Collins, I., Errington, J., and Czaplewski, L. G. (2008) Science 312, 1673-1675). We have found that the benzamide derivative PC190723 is an FtsZ polymer-stabilizing agent. PC190723 induced nucleated assembly of Bs-FtsZ into single-stranded coiled protofilaments and polymorphic condensates, including bundles, coils, and toroids, whose formation could be modulated with different solution conditions. Under conditions for reversible assembly of Bs-FtsZ, PC190723 binding reduced the GTPase activity and induced the formation of straight bundles and ribbons, which was also observed with Sa-FtsZ but not with nonsusceptible Ec-FtsZ. The fragment 2,6-difluoro-3-methoxybenzamide also induced Bs-FtsZ bundling. We propose that polymer stabilization by PC190723 suppresses in vivo FtsZ polymer dynamics and bacterial division. The biochemical action of PC190723 on FtsZ parallels that of the microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol on the eukaryotic structural homologue tubulin. Both taxol and PC190723 stabilize polymers against disassembly by preferential binding to each assembled protein. It is yet to be investigated whether both ligands target structurally related assembly switches.},

Here we study this decision process in individual cells, focusing on the dynamics of the transition from the off- to the on-state. Using quantitative time-lapse microscopy, we determine the time delay between inducer addition and fluorescence onset of a GFP reporter. Through independent characterization of the GFP maturation process, we can separate the lag time caused by the reporter from the intrinsic activation time of the arabinose system. The resulting distribution of intrinsic time delays scales inversely with the external arabinose concentration, and is compatible with a simple stochastic model for arabinose uptake. Our findings support the idea that the heterogeneous timing of gene induction is causally related to a broad distribution of uptake proteins at the time of sugar addition.},

abstract = {Using a single-molecule fluorescence approach, the time series of catalytic events of an enzymatic reaction can be monitored, yielding a sequence of fluorescent "on"- and "off"-states. An accurate on/off-assignment is complicated by the intrinsic and extrinsic noise in every single-molecule fluorescence experiment. Using simulated data, the performance of the most widely employed binning and thresholding approach was systematically compared to change point analysis. It is shown that the underlying on- and off-histograms as well as the off-autocorrelation are not necessarily extracted from the "signal'' buried in noise. The shapes of the on- and off-histograms are affected by artifacts introduced by the analysis procedure and depend on the signal-to-noise ratio and the overall fluorescence intensity. For experimental data where the background intensity is not constant over time we consider change point analysis to be more accurate. When using change point analysis for data of the enzyme $\alpha$-chymotrypsin, no characteristics of dynamic disorder was found. In light of these results, dynamic disorder might not be a general sign of enzymatic reactions.},

abstract = {Gene expression in metazoans is regulated not only at the level of individual genes but also in a coordinated manner across large chromosomal domains (for example centromeres, telomeres and imprinted gene clusters) and along entire chromosomes (for example X-chromosome dosage compensation). The primary DNA sequence usually specifies the regulation of individual genes, but the nature of cis-acting information that controls genes over large regions has been elusive: higher-order DNA structure, specific histone modifications, subnuclear compartmentalization and primary DNA sequence are possibilities. One paradigm of chromosome-wide gene regulation is Caenorhabditis elegans dosage compensation in which a large dosage compensation complex (DCC) is targeted to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites to repress transcript levels by half. This essential process equalizes X-linked gene expression between the sexes (XO males and XX hermaphrodites). Here we report the discovery and dissection of cis-acting sites that mark nematode X chromosomes as targets for gene repression by the DCC. These rex (recruitment element on X) sites are widely dispersed along X and reside in promoters, exons and intergenic regions. rex sites share at least two distinct motifs that act in combination to recruit the DCC. Mutating these motifs severely reduces or abolishes DCC binding in vivo, demonstrating the importance of primary DNA sequence in chromosome-wide regulation. Unexpectedly, the motifs are not enriched on X, but altering motif numbers within rex sites demonstrates that motif co-occurrence in unusually high densities is essential for optimal DCC recruitment. Thus, X-specific repression is established through sequences not specific to X. The distribution of common motifs provides the foundation for repression along an entire chromosome.},

abstract = {An improved vector system has been developed for the in vitro construction of transcriptional fusions to lacZ. The principal feature is an RNaseIII cleavage site inserted between the polylinker cloning site and the promoterless lacZ gene. When these vectors are used to construct transcriptional fusions, the subsequent cleavage of the hybrid mRNA at the RNaseIII site generates an unchanging 5' end for the lacZ mRNA. In contrast to earlier vectors, this feature helps to ensure independent translation of the lacZ mRNA and, thus, the level of beta-galactosidase produced should accurately reflect the frequency of transcription of the upstream DNA sequences. Additional modifications of the vectors include removal of a weak transcriptional terminator between the cloning site and lacZ, insertion of a terminator downstream of lac, and alteration of restriction endonuclease cleavage sites to facilitate the in vitro construction of fusions. Both multicopy plasmid (pTL61T) and single-copy lambda (lambda TL61) vectors have been assembled. These vectors should be generally useful in scanning for transcriptional regulatory signals.},

abstract = {Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) controls the order in which different carbon sources are metabolized. Although this system is one of the paradigms of the regulation of gene expression in bacteria, the underlying mechanisms remain controversial. CCR involves the coordination of different subsystems of the cell that are responsible for the uptake of carbon sources, their breakdown for the production of energy and precursors, and the conversion of the latter to biomass. The complexity of this integrated system, with regulatory mechanisms cutting across metabolism, gene expression, and signaling, and that are subject to global physical and physiological constraints, has motivated important modeling efforts over the past four decades, especially in the enterobacterium Escherichia coli. Different hypotheses concerning the dynamic functioning of the system have been explored by a variety of modeling approaches. We review these studies and summarize their contributions to the quantitative understanding of CCR, focusing on diauxic growth in E. coli. Moreover, we propose a highly simplified representation of diauxic growth that makes it possible to bring out the salient features of the models proposed in the literature and confront and compare the explanations they provide.},

abstract = {Microbes survive in a variety of nutrient environments by modulating their intracellular metabolism. Balanced growth requires coordinated uptake of carbon and nitrogen, the primary substrates for biomass production. Yet the mechanisms that balance carbon and nitrogen uptake are poorly understood. We find in Escherichia coli that a sudden increase in nitrogen availability results in an almost immediate increase in glucose uptake. The concentrations of glycolytic intermediates and known regulators, however, remain homeostatic. Instead, we find that $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, which accumulates in nitrogen limitation, directly blocks glucose uptake by inhibiting enzyme I, the first step of the sugar-phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS). This inhibition enables rapid modulation of glycolytic flux without marked changes in the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates by simultaneously altering import of glucose and consumption of the terminal glycolytic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate. Quantitative modeling shows that this previously unidentified regulatory connection is, in principle, sufficient to coordinate carbon and nitrogen utilization.},

abstract = {The side chains of Escherichia coli phosphofructokinase (EcPFK) that interact with bound substrate, fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P), are examined for their potential roles in allosteric regulation. Mutations that severely decrease Fru-6-P affinity and/or k(cat)/K(m) were created at each contact residue, with the exception of the catalytic base, D127. Even though Fru-6-P affinity was greatly decreased for R162E, M169A, E222A/H223A, and R243E, the mutated proteins retained the ability to be activated by MgADP and inhibited by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). R252E did not show an allosteric response to either MgADP or PEP. The H249E mutation retained MgADP activation but did not respond to PEP. R72E, T125A, and R171E maintained allosteric inhibition by PEP. Both R72E and T125A displayed a MgADP-dependent decrease in k(cat) but no MgADP-dependent K-type effects. R171E maintained MgADP-dependent K-type activation but also displayed a MgADP-dependent decrease in k(cat). Localization of mutations that alter MgADP activation near the transferred phosphate group indicates the importance of the 1-methoxy region of Fru-6-P in allosteric regulation by MgADP. A region near the 6'-phosphate may be similarly important for PEP inhibition. R252 is uniquely positioned between the 1'- and 6'-phosphates of bound Fru-1,6-BP, and the mutation at this position may alter both allosterically responsive regions. The differential functions of specific regions in the Fru-6-P contact residues support different mechanisms for allosteric activation and inhibition. In addition, the lack of correlation between mutations that decrease Fru-6-P affinity and those that abolish allosteric communications supports the independence of affinity and allosteric coupling.},

abstract = {The robust surface adherence property of the aquatic bacterium Caulobacter crescentus permits visualization of single cells in a linear microfluidic culture chamber over an extended number of generations. The division rate of Caulobacter in this continuous-flow culture environment is substantially faster than in other culture apparati and is independent of flow velocity. Analysis of the growth and division of single isogenic cells reveals that the cell cycle control network of this bacterium generates an oscillatory output with a coefficient of variation lower than that of all other bacterial species measured to date. DivJ, a regulator of polar cell development, is necessary for maintaining low variance in interdivision timing, as transposon disruption of divJ significantly increases the coefficient of variation of both interdivision time and the rate of cell elongation. Moreover, interdivision time and cell division arrest are significantly correlated between mother and daughter cells, providing evidence for epigenetic inheritance of cell division behavior in Caulobacter. The single-cell growth/division results reported here suggest that future predictive models of Caulobacter cell cycle regulation should include parameters describing the variance and inheritance properties of this system.},

Here we show that this relation, which we call the gene regulation function (GRF), fluctuates dynamically in individual living cells, thereby limiting the accuracy with which transcriptional genetic circuits can transfer signals. Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter P(R) in Escherichia coli. A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones.},

abstract = {Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is a widespread mechanism of inter-bacterial competition mediated by the CdiB/CdiA family of two-partner secretion proteins. CdiA effectors carry diverse C-terminal toxin domains (CdiA-CT), which are delivered into neighboring target cells to inhibit growth. CDI+ bacteria also produce CdiI immunity proteins that bind specifically to cognate CdiA-CT toxins and protect the cell from auto-inhibition. Here, we compare the structures of homologous CdiA-CT/CdiI complexes from Escherichia coli EC869 and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis YPIII to explore the evolution of CDI toxin/immunity protein interactions. Both complexes share an unusual ??-augmentation interaction, in which the toxin domain extends a ??-hairpin into the immunity protein to complete a six-stranded anti-parallel sheet. However, the specific contacts differ substantially between the two complexes. The EC869 ??-hairpin interacts mainly through direct H-bond and ion-pair interactions, whereas the YPIII ??-hairpin pocket contains more hydrophobic contacts and a network of bridging water molecules. In accord with these differences, we find that each CdiI protein only protects target bacteria from its cognate CdiA-CT toxin. The compact ??-hairpin binding pocket within the immunity protein represents a tractable system for the rationale design of small molecules to block CdiA-CT/CdiI complex formation. We synthesized a macrocyclic peptide mimic of the ??-hairpin from EC869 toxin and solved its structure in complex with cognate immunity protein. These latter studies suggest that small molecules could potentially be used to disrupt CDI toxin/immunity complexes.},

We report that both Cps60 and Cps40 components of COMPASS are required for proper histone H3 trimethylation, but not for proper regulation of telomere-associated gene silencing. Purified COMPASS lacking Cps60 can mono- and dimethylate but is not capable of trimethylating H3(K4). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies indicate that the loss subunits of COMPASS required for histone trimethylation do not affect the localization of Set1 to chromatin for the genes tested. Collectively, our results suggest a molecular requirement for several components of COMPASS for proper histone H3 trimethylation and regulation of telomere-associated gene expression, indicating multiple roles for different forms of histone methylation by COMPASS.},

Positioning of the Z-ring at midcell is thought to be coordinated by two regulatory systems, nucleoid occlusion and the Min system. In E. coli, nucleoid occlusion is mediated by the SlmA proteins. Here, we address the question of whether there are additional positioning systems that are capable of localizing the E. coli divisome with respect to the cell center. Using quantitative fluorescence imaging we show that slow growing cells lacking functional Min and SlmA nucleoid occlusion systems continue to divide preferentially at midcell. We find that the initial Z-ring assembly occurs over the center of the nucleoid instead of nucleoid-free regions under these conditions. We determine that Z-ring formation begins shortly after the arrival of the Ter macrodomain at the nucleoid center. Removal of either the MatP, ZapB, or ZapA proteins significantly affects the accuracy and precision of Z-ring positioning relative to the nucleoid center in these cells in accordance with the idea that these proteins link the Ter macrodomain and the Z-ring. Interestingly, even in the absence of Min, SlmA, and the putative Ter macrodomain - Z-ring link, there remains a weak midcell positioning bias for the Z-ring. Our work demonstrates that additional Z-ring localization systems are present in E. coli than are known currently. In particular, we identify that the Ter macrodomain acts as a landmark for the Z-ring in the presence of MatP, ZapB and ZapA proteins.},

abstract = {The RelA-mediated stringent response is at the heart of bacterial adaptation to starvation and stress, playing a major role in the bacterial cell cycle and virulence. RelA integrates several environmental cues and synthesizes the alarmone ppGpp, which globally reprograms transcription, translation, and replication. We have developed and implemented novel single-molecule tracking methodology to characterize the intracellular catalytic cycle of RelA. Our single-molecule experiments show that RelA is on the ribosome under nonstarved conditions and that the individual enzyme molecule stays off the ribosome for an extended period of time after activation. This suggests that the catalytically active part of the RelA cycle is performed off, rather than on, the ribosome, and that rebinding to the ribosome is not necessary to trigger each ppGpp synthesis event. Furthermore, we find fast activation of RelA in response to heat stress followed by RelA rapidly being reset to its inactive state, which makes the system sensitive to new environmental cues and hints at an underlying excitable response mechanism.},

abstract = {Accurate chromosome alignment at metaphase and subsequent segregation of condensed chromosomes is a complex process involving elaborate and only partially characterized molecular machinery. Although several spindle associated molecular motors have been shown to be essential for mitotic function, only a few chromosome arm--associated motors have been described. Here, we show that human chromokinesin human HKIF4A (HKIF4A) is an essential chromosome-associated molecular motor involved in faithful chromosome segregation. HKIF4A localizes in the nucleoplasm during interphase and on condensed chromosome arms during mitosis. It accumulates in the mid-zone from late anaphase and localizes to the cytokinetic ring during cytokinesis. RNA interference--mediated depletion of HKIF4A in human cells results in defective prometaphase organization, chromosome mis-alignment at metaphase, spindle defects, and chromosome mis-segregation. HKIF4A interacts with the condensin I and II complexes and HKIF4A depletion results in chromosome hypercondensation, suggesting that HKIF4A is required for maintaining normal chromosome architecture. Our results provide functional evidence that human KIF4A is a novel component of the chromosome condensation and segregation machinery functioning in multiple steps of mitotic division.},

abstract = {In a living cell, gene expression--the transcription of DNA to messenger RNA followed by translation to protein--occurs stochastically, as a consequence of the low copy number of DNA and mRNA molecules involved. These stochastic events of protein production are difficult to observe directly with measurements on large ensembles of cells owing to lack of synchronization among cells. Measurements so far on single cells lack the sensitivity to resolve individual events of protein production. Here we demonstrate a microfluidic-based assay that allows real-time observation of the expression of beta-galactosidase in living Escherichia coli cells with single molecule sensitivity. We observe that protein production occurs in bursts, with the number of molecules per burst following an exponential distribution. We show that the two key parameters of protein expression--the burst size and frequency--can be either determined directly from real-time monitoring of protein production or extracted from a measurement of the steady-state copy number distribution in a population of cells. Application of this assay to probe gene expression in individual budding yeast and mouse embryonic stem cells demonstrates its generality. Many important proteins are expressed at low levels, and are thus inaccessible by current genomic and proteomic techniques. This microfluidic single cell assay opens up possibilities for system-wide characterization of the expression of these low copy number proteins.},

@article{Schmitt-Ney2000,
abstract = {CHOP/GADD153 is both an activating and repressing transcription factor that is markedly induced in response to a variety of cellular stresses. The CHOP/GADD153 gene was originally cloned because of its inducibility by ultraviolet light wavelength band C (UVC) and has since been found to be activated in response to many different cellular stresses. Some of the recent studies have questioned the UVC responsiveness of the CHOP gene. Contradiction in our own data led us to reexamine the UVC effects on CHOP expression. UVC is capable of strongly activating the mouse CHOP promoter in stably transfected NIH 3T3 cells but has only a modest and transient effect on the level of the CHOP messenger RNA. In addition to its positive effect on CHOP promoter activity, we show that UVC negatively affects CHOP mRNA and protein expression. Pretreatment of NIH 3T3 cells with UVC markedly attenuates the subsequent induction of CHOP mRNA by the cellular stress activators methylmethane sulfate, tunicamycin, glucose deprivation, and methionine deprivation for as long as at least 16 h. This inhibitory effect of UVC on CHOP expression in response to stress is independent of the presence or absence of p53 and does not involve mRNA degradation as opposed to the UVC effect that inhibits p21 expression seen only in the absence of p53. The target of the inhibitory effect of UVC on CHOP expression is located in the first exon of the gene, a 5'-untranslated region that is unusually conserved between different species. These findings suggest that an unknown function encoded by the 5'-untranslated region somehow modifies the response of CHOP gene transcription to UVC.},

abstract = {Although protein expression is regulated both temporally and spatially, most proteins have an intrinsic, "typical" range of functionally effective abundance levels. These extend from a few molecules per cell for signaling proteins, to millions of molecules for structural proteins. When addressing fundamental questions related to protein evolution, translation and folding, but also in routine laboratory work, a simple rough estimate of the average wild type abundance of each detectable protein in an organism is often desirable. Here, we introduce a meta-resource dedicated to integrating information on absolute protein abundance levels; we place particular emphasis on deep coverage, consistent post-processing and comparability across different organisms. Publicly available experimental data are mapped onto a common namespace and, in the case of tandem mass spectrometry data, re-processed using a standardized spectral counting pipeline. By aggregating and averaging over the various samples, conditions and cell-types, the resulting integrated data set achieves increased coverage and a high dynamic range. We score and rank each contributing, individual data set by assessing its consistency against externally provided protein-network information, and demonstrate that our weighted integration exhibits more consistency than the data sets individually. The current PaxDb-release 2.1 (at http://pax-db.org/) presents whole-organism data as well as tissue-resolved data, and covers 85,000 proteins in 12 model organisms. All values can be seamlessly compared across organisms via pre-computed orthology relationships.},

We developed a method based on picoliter water-in-oil droplets to induce coacervation in Escherichia coli cell lysate and follow gene expression under crowded and noncrowded conditions. Coacervation creates an artificial cell-like environment in which the rate of mRNA production is increased significantly. Fits to the measured transcription rates show a two orders of magnitude larger binding constant between DNA and T7 RNA polymerase, and five to six times larger rate constant for transcription in crowded environments, strikingly similar to in vivo rates. The effect of crowding on interactions and kinetics of the fundamental machinery of gene expression has a direct impact on our understanding of biochemical networks in vivo. Moreover, our results show the intrinsic potential of cellular components to facilitate macromolecular organization into membrane-free compartments by phase separation.},

The unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 moves with Type IV pili and measures light intensity and color with a range of photoreceptors. Here, we show that individual Synechocystis cells do not respond to a spatiotemporal gradient in light intensity, but rather they directly and accurately sense the position of a light source. We show that directional light sensing is possible because Synechocystis cells act as spherical microlenses, allowing the cell to see a light source and move towards it. A high-resolution image of the light source is focused on the edge of the cell opposite to the source, triggering movement away from the focused spot. Spherical cyanobacteria are probably the world's smallest and oldest example of a camera eye.},

abstract = {Reconstituting an elementary gene expression system inside self-assembled lipid vesicles to mimic the cellular synthesis machinery is at the core of the development of a minimal cell following a bottom-up synthetic biology approach. The ability to operate the expression of multiple genes in a controlled manner and to generate the output proteins with predictable dynamics in liposomes relies on the link between genotype and phenotype. Here, we established this link in surface-tethered liposomes producing proteins from a linear DNA template using a reconstituted transcription/translation/aminoacylation apparatus fuelled by external supply of feedstock. The amounts of entrapped DNA molecules and synthesized proteins were visualized by fluorescence confocal microscopy in individual vesicles. We showed that there exists no linear correlation between the amount of encapsulated genes and the level of output proteins, which is a consequence of the compositional heterogeneity between liposomes due to the low-copy number of some constituents, as well as interfacing differences with the nutrient-containing environment. In order to decouple gene activity from those sources of variability and, thus, infer the probabilistic occupancy of transcriptionally active genes in protein synthesizing liposomes, we developed a dual gene expression assay consisting of the production of two fluorescent reporter proteins of distinguishable colors from two different DNA templates. The stochastic color-coding of the vesicles was analyzed and compared to the color pattern expected from a Poisson distribution of encapsulated genes. Unexpectedly, we found that the apparent number of transcriptionally active DNA molecules in liposomes corresponds only to ca. 10{\%} of the bulk concentration. We believe that our study provides new insights about the relationship between the genotype and phenotype in protein synthesizing liposomes, which is of primary importance toward the construction of a programmable artificial cell implemented with regulatory gene networks of predictable dynamics.},

abstract = {FtsZ, a bacterial homolog of tubulin, is well established as forming the cytoskeletal framework for the cytokinetic ring. Recent work has shown that purified FtsZ, in the absence of any other division proteins, can assemble Z rings when incorporated inside tubular liposomes. Moreover, these artificial Z rings can generate a constriction force, demonstrating that FtsZ is its own force generator. Here we review light microscope observations of how Z rings assemble in bacteria. Assembly begins with long-pitch helices that condense into the Z ring. Once formed, the Z ring can transition to short-pitch helices that are suggestive of its structure. FtsZ assembles in vitro into short protofilaments that are â¼30 subunits long. We present models for how these protofilaments might be further assembled into the Z ring. We discuss recent experiments on assembly dynamics of FtsZ in vitro, with particular attention to how two regulatory proteins, SulA and MinC, inhibit assembly.

abstract = {Escherichia coli strain MG1655 was chosen for sequencing because the few mutations it carries (ilvG rfb-50 rph-1) were considered innocuous. However, it has a number of growth defects. Internal pyrimidine starvation due to polarity of the rph-1 allele on pyrE was problematic in continuous culture. Moreover, the isolate of MG1655 obtained from the E. coli Genetic Stock Center also carries a large deletion around the fnr (fumarate- nitrate respiration) regulatory gene. Although studies on DNA microarrays revealed apparent cross-regulation of gene expression between galactose and lactose metabolism in the Stock Center isolate of MG1655, this was due to the occurrence of mutations that increased lacY expression and suppressed slow growth on galactose. The explanation for apparent cross-regulation between galactose and N-acetylglucosamine metabolism was similar. By contrast, cross-regulation between lactose and maltose metabolism appeared to be due to gener- ation of internal maltosaccharides in lactose-grown cells and may be physiologically significant. Lactose is of restricted distribution: it is normally found together with maltosaccharides, which are starch degradation products, in the mammalian intestine. Strains designated MG1655 and obtained from other sources differed from the Stock Center isolate and each other in several respects. We confirmed that use of other E. coli strains with MG1655-based DNA microarrays works well, and hence these arrays can be used to study any strain of interest. The responses to nitrogen limitation of two urinary tract isolates and an intestinal commensal strain isolated recently from humans were remarkably similar to those of MG1655.},

Much of what is known concerning the molecular basis for translational control has been gleaned from experiments (e.g., luciferase assays and polysome analysis) that measure average changes in the protein synthesis of a population of cells, however, mechanistic insights can be obscured in ensemble measurements. The development of fluorescent microscopy techniques and reagents has allowed translation to be studied within its cellular context. Here we highlight recent methodologies that can be used to study global changes in protein synthesis or regulation of specific mRNAs in single cells. Imaging of translation has provided direct evidence for local translation of mRNAs at synapses in neurons and will become an important tool for studying translational control.},

abstract = {In Escherichia coli more than 180 genes are regulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex. However, more than 90{\%} of cAMP that is made by intracellular adenylyl cyclases is found in the culture medium. How is cAMP exported from E. coli? In a tolC mutant, 0.03 mM IPTG (isopropyl-$\beta$-d-thiogalactopyranoside) was sufficient to induce $\beta$-galactosidase compared to 0.1 mM IPTG in the parent strain. In a cya mutant unable to produce cAMP about 1 mM extracellular cAMP was required to induce $\beta$-galactosidase, whereas in a cya tolC mutant 0.1 mM cAMP was sufficient. When cAMP in E. coli cya was generated intracellularly by a recombinant, weakly active adenylyl cyclase from Corynebacterium glutamicum, the critical level of cAMP necessary for induction of maltose degradation was only achieved in a tolC mutant and not in the parent strain. Deletion of a putative cAMP phosphodiesterase of E. coli, CpdA, resulted in a slightly similar, yet more diffuse phenotype. The data demonstrate that export of cAMP via TolC is a most efficient way of E. coli to lower high concentrations of cAMP in the cell and maintain its sensitivity in changing metabolic environments.},

abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequorea victoria has provided a myriad of applications for biological systems. Over the last several years, mutagenesis studies have improved folding properties of GFP (refs 1,2). However, slow maturation is still a big obstacle to the use of GFP variants for visualization. These problems are exacerbated when GFP variants are expressed at 37 degrees C and/or targeted to certain organelles. Thus, obtaining GFP variants that mature more efficiently is crucial for the development of expanded research applications. Among Aequorea GFP variants, yellow fluorescent proteins (YFPs) are relatively acid-sensitive, and uniquely quenched by chloride ion (Cl-). For YFP to be fully and stably fluorescent, mutations that decrease the sensitivity to both pH and Cl- are desired. Here we describe the development of an improved version of YFP named "Venus". Venus contains a novel mutation, F46L, which at 37 degrees C greatly accelerates oxidation of the chromophore, the rate-limiting step of maturation. As a result of other mutations, F64L/M153T/V163A/S175G, Venus folds well and is relatively tolerant of exposure to acidosis and Cl-. We succeeded in efficiently targeting a neuropeptide Y-Venus fusion protein to the dense-core granules of PC12 cells. Its secretion was readily monitored by measuring release of fluorescence into the medium. The use of Venus as an acceptor allowed early detection of reliable signals of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) for Ca2+ measurements in brain slices. With the improved speed and efficiency of maturation and the increased resistance to environment, Venus will enable fluorescent labelings that were not possible before.},

abstract = {Understanding the genetic basis of adaptation is a central problem in biology. However, revealing the underlying molecular mechanisms has been challenging as changes in fitness may result from perturbations to many pathways, any of which may contribute relatively little. We have developed a combined experimental/computational framework to address this problem and used it to understand the genetic basis of ethanol tolerance in Escherichia coli. We used fitness profiling to measure the consequences of single-locus perturbations in the context of ethanol exposure. A module-level computational analysis was then used to reveal the organization of the contributing loci into cellular processes and regulatory pathways (e.g. osmoregulation and cell-wall biogenesis) whose modifications significantly affect ethanol tolerance. Strikingly, we discovered that a dominant component of adaptation involves metabolic rewiring that boosts intracellular ethanol degradation and assimilation. Through phenotypic and metabolomic analysis of laboratory-evolved ethanol-tolerant strains, we investigated naturally accessible pathways of ethanol tolerance. Remarkably, these laboratory-evolved strains, by and large, follow the same adaptive paths as inferred from our coarse-grained search of the fitness landscape.},

@article{VanZon2006,
abstract = {We study by Green's Function Reaction Dynamics the effect of the diffusive motion of repressor molecules on the noise in mRNA and protein levels for a gene that is under the control of a repressor. We find that spatial fluctuations due to diffusion can drastically enhance the noise in gene expression. After dissociation from the operator, a repressor can rapidly rebind to the DNA. Our results show that the rebinding trajectories are so short that, on this timescale, the RNA polymerase (RNAP) cannot effectively compete with the repressor for binding to the promoter. As a result, a dissociated repressor molecule will on average rebind many times, before it eventually diffuses away. These rebindings thus lower the effective dissociation rate, and this increases the noise in gene expression. Another consequence of the timescale separation between repressor rebinding and RNAP association is that the effect of spatial fluctuations can be described by a well-stirred, zero-dimensional, model by renormalizing the reaction rates for repressor-DNA (un) binding. Our results thus support the use of well-stirred, zero-dimensional models for describing noise in gene expression. We also show that for a fixed repressor strength, the noise due to diffusion can be minimized by increasing the number of repressors or by decreasing the rate of the open complex formation. Lastly, our results emphasize that power spectra are a highly useful tool for studying the propagation of noise through the different stages of gene expression.},

Additionally, by coculturing strains harboring different antibiotic resistance genes, we demonstrated that molecular exchange enables cells to transiently acquire nonhereditary resistance. Furthermore, nonconjugative plasmids could be transferred from one cell to another, thereby conferring hereditary features to recipient cells. Electron microscopy revealed the existence of variously sized tubular extensions bridging neighboring cells, serving as a route for exchange of intracellular molecules. These nanotubes also formed in an interspecies manner, between B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, and even between B. subtilis and the evolutionary distant bacterium Escherichia coli. We propose that nanotubes represent a major form of bacterial communication in nature, providing a network for exchange of cellular molecules within and between species.},

abstract = {Stochasticity in gene regulation has been characterized extensively, but how it affects cellular growth and fitness is less clear. We study the growth of E. coli cells as they shift from glucose to lactose metabolism, which is characterized by an obligatory growth arrest in bulk experiments that is termed the lag phase. Here, we follow the growth dynamics of individual cells at minute-resolution using a single-cell assay in a microfluidic device during this shift, while also monitoring lac expression. Mirroring the bulk results, the majority of cells displays a growth arrest upon glucose exhaustion, and resume when triggered by stochastic lac expression events. However, a significant fraction of cells maintains a high rate of elongation and displays no detectable growth lag during the shift. This ability to suppress the growth lag should provide important selective advantages when nutrients are scarce. Trajectories of individual cells display a highly non-linear relation between lac expression and growth, with only a fraction of fully induced levels being sufficient for achieving near maximal growth. A stochastic molecular model together with measured dependencies between nutrient concentration, lac expression level, and growth accurately reproduces the observed switching distributions. The results show that a growth arrest is not obligatory in the classic diauxic shift, and underscore that regulatory stochasticity ought to be considered in terms of its impact on growth and survival.},

abstract = {The Ras-specific guanine nucleotide-exchange factors Son of sevenless (Sos) and Ras guanine nucleotide-releasing factor 1 (RasGRF1) transduce extracellular stimuli into Ras activation by catalyzing the exchange of Ras-bound GDP for GTP. A truncated form of RasGRF1 containing only the core catalytic Cdc25 domain is sufficient for stimulating Ras nucleotide exchange, whereas the isolated Cdc25 domain of Sos is inactive. At a site distal to the catalytic site, nucleotide-bound Ras binds to Sos, making contacts with the Cdc25 domain and with a Ras exchanger motif (Rem) domain. This allosteric Ras binding stimulates nucleotide exchange by Sos, but the mechanism by which this stimulation occurs has not been defined. We present a crystal structure of the Rem and Cdc25 domains of Sos determined at 2.0-A resolution in the absence of Ras. Differences between this structure and that of Sos bound to two Ras molecules show that allosteric activation of Sos by Ras occurs through a rotation of the Rem domain that is coupled to a rotation of a helical hairpin at the Sos catalytic site. This motion relieves steric occlusion of the catalytic site, allowing substrate Ras binding and nucleotide exchange. A structure of the isolated RasGRF1 Cdc25 domain determined at 2.2-A resolution, combined with computational analyses, suggests that the Cdc25 domain of RasGRF1 is able to maintain an active conformation in isolation because the helical hairpin has strengthened interactions with the Cdc25 domain core. These results indicate that RasGRF1 lacks the allosteric activation switch that is crucial for Sos activity.},

abstract = {As many as 59{\%} of the transcription factors in Escherichia coli regulate the transcription rate of their own genes. This suggests that auto-regulation has one or more important functions. Here, one possible function is studied. Often the transcription rate of an auto-regulator is also controlled by additional transcription factors. In these cases, the way the expression of the auto-regulator responds to changes in the concentrations of the "input" regulators (the response function) is obviously affected by the auto-regulation. We suggest that, conversely, auto-regulation may be used to optimize this response function. To test this hypothesis, we use an evolutionary algorithm and a chemical-physical model of transcription regulation to design model cis-regulatory constructs with predefined response functions. In these simulations, auto-regulation can evolve if this provides a functional benefit. When selecting for a series of elementary response functions-Boolean logic gates and linear responses-the cis-regulatory regions resulting from the simulations indeed often exploit auto-regulation. Surprisingly, the resulting constructs use auto-activation rather than auto-repression. Several design principles show up repeatedly in the simulation results. They demonstrate how auto-activation can be used to generate sharp, switch-like activation and repression circuits and how linearly decreasing response functions can be obtained. Auto-repression, on the other hand, resulted only when a high response speed or a suppression of intrinsic noise was also selected for. The results suggest that, while auto-repression may primarily be valuable to improve the dynamical properties of regulatory circuits, auto-activation is likely to evolve even when selection acts on the shape of response function only.},

Our results suggest that the condensin complexes represent the most abundant structural components of mitotic chromosomes and play a central role in driving chromosome condensation.},

abstract = {Gene expression is controlled by the joint effect of (i) the global physiological state of the cell, in particular the activity of the gene expression machinery, and (ii) DNA-binding transcription factors and other specific regulators. We present a model-based approach to distinguish between these two effects using time-resolved measurements of promoter activities. We demonstrate the strength of the approach by analyzing a circuit involved in the regulation of carbon metabolism in E. coli. Our results show that the transcriptional response of the network is controlled by the physiological state of the cell and the signaling metabolite cyclic AMP (cAMP). The absence of a strong regulatory effect of transcription factors suggests that they are not the main coordinators of gene expression changes during growth transitions, but rather that they complement the effect of global physiological control mechanisms. This change of perspective has important consequences for the interpretation of transcriptome data and the design of biological networks in biotechnology and synthetic biology.},

@article{Marks2011,
abstract = {The evolutionary trajectory of a protein through sequence space is constrained by its function. Collections of sequence homologs record the outcomes of millions of evolutionary experiments in which the protein evolves according to these constraints. Deciphering the evolutionary record held in these sequences and exploiting it for predictive and engineering purposes presents a formidable challenge. The potential benefit of solving this challenge is amplified by the advent of inexpensive high-throughput genomic sequencing.In this paper we ask whether we can infer evolutionary constraints from a set of sequence homologs of a protein. The challenge is to distinguish true co-evolution couplings from the noisy set of observed correlations. We address this challenge using a maximum entropy model of the protein sequence, constrained by the statistics of the multiple sequence alignment, to infer residue pair couplings. Surprisingly, we find that the strength of these inferred couplings is an excellent predictor of residue-residue proximity in folded structures. Indeed, the top-scoring residue couplings are sufficiently accurate and well-distributed to define the 3D protein fold with remarkable accuracy.We quantify this observation by computing, from sequence alone, all-atom 3D structures of fifteen test proteins from different fold classes, ranging in size from 50 to 260 residues, including a G-protein coupled receptor. These blinded inferences are de novo, i.e., they do not use homology modeling or sequence-similar fragments from known structures. The co-evolution signals provide sufficient information to determine accurate 3D protein structure to 2.7-4.8 {\AA} C($\alpha$)-RMSD error relative to the observed structure, over at least two-thirds of the protein (method called EVfold, details at http://EVfold.org). This discovery provides insight into essential interactions constraining protein evolution and will facilitate a comprehensive survey of the universe of protein structures, new strategies in protein and drug design, and the identification of functional genetic variants in normal and disease genomes.},

abstract = {The Escherichia coli chemotaxis network is a model system for biological signal processing. In E. coli, transmembrane receptors responsible for signal transduction assemble into large clusters containing several thousand proteins. These sensory clusters have been observed at cell poles and future division sites. Despite extensive study, it remains unclear how chemotaxis clusters form, what controls cluster size and density, and how the cellular location of clusters is robustly maintained in growing and dividing cells. Here, we use photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) to map the cellular locations of three proteins central to bacterial chemotaxis (the Tar receptor, CheY, and CheW) with a precision of 15 nm. We find that cluster sizes are approximately exponentially distributed, with no characteristic cluster size. One-third of Tar receptors are part of smaller lateral clusters and not of the large polar clusters. Analysis of the relative cellular locations of 1.1 million individual proteins (from 326 cells) suggests that clusters form via stochastic self-assembly. The super-resolution PALM maps of E. coli receptors support the notion that stochastic self-assembly can create and maintain approximately periodic structures in biological membranes, without direct cytoskeletal involvement or active transport.},

Filamentation began to occur 5 d after the imposition of starvation conditions. Dumbbell shaped cells were also observed, although apparent 'Y' and 'V'-shaped cells proved to be artefacts, caused by overlapping rods. The implications of the appearance of pleomorphism in E. coli, when grown under starvation conditions, is discussed in relation to its pathogenicity and growth in the environment.},

Here we present a technique that converts observed fluorescence intensities into numbers of molecules. By transiently expressing a fluorescently tagged protein and then following its dilution during growth and division, we observe asymmetric partitioning of fluorescence between daughter cells at each division. Such partition asymmetries are set by the actual numbers of proteins present, and thus provide a means to quantify fluorescence levels. We present a Bayesian algorithm that infers from such data both the fluorescence conversion factor and an estimate of the measurement error. Our algorithm works for arbitrarily sized data sets and handles consistently any missing measurements. We verify the algorithm with extensive simulation and demonstrate its application to experimental data from Escherichia coli. Our technique should provide a quantitative internal calibration to systems biology studies of both synthetic and endogenous cellular networks.},

abstract = {This study quantifies the contribution of each of the four unique inhibiting heterotropic interactions between the allosteric inhibitor, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), and the substrate, fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P), in phosphofructokinase from Escherichia coli (EcPFK). The unique heterotropic interactions, previously labeled by the distances between ligand binding sites, were isolated independently by constructing hybrid tetramers. Of the four unique heterotropic PEP-Fru-6-P interactions, the 45 A interaction contributed 25{\%}, the 30 A interaction contributed 31{\%}, and the 23 A interaction contributed 42{\%} of the total PEP inhibition. The 33 A interaction actually causes a small activation of Fru-6-P binding by PEP and therefore contributed -8{\%} of the total observed PEP inhibition. The pattern of relative contribution to PEP inhibition from each interaction in EcPFK does not follow the same pattern seen in MgADP activation of EcPFK. This observation supports the conclusion that although PEP and MgADP bind to the same site, they do not use the same communication pathways to influence the active site. The pattern of relative contribution describing PEP inhibition observed in this study also does not follow the pattern determined for PEP inhibition in phosphofructokinase from Bacillus stearothermophilus, suggesting that these two highly homologous isoforms are not inhibited in the same manner by PEP.},

To eliminate this drawback of the theory, we introduce a new complementary diffusion equation in the boundary layer with an appropriate matching condition.

It has previously been hypothesized that X-linked genes are expressed at twice the level of autosomal genes per active allele to balance the gene dose between the X chromosome and autosomes (termed 'Ohno's hypothesis'). This hypothesis was supported by the observation that microarray-based gene expression levels were indistinguishable between one X chromosome and two autosomes (the X to two autosomes ratio (X:AA) {\~{}}1). Here we show that RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is more sensitive than microarray and that RNA-Seq data reveal an X:AA ratio of {\~{}}0.5 in human and mouse. In Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodites, the X:AA ratio reduces progressively from {\~{}}1 in larvae to {\~{}}0.5 in adults. Proteomic data are consistent with the RNA-Seq results and further suggest the lack of X upregulation at the protein level. Together, our findings reject Ohno's hypothesis, necessitating a major revision of the current model of dosage compensation in the evolution of sex chromosomes.},

abstract = {The citrate synthase of Escherichia coli is an example of a Type II citrate synthase, a hexamer that is subject to allosteric inhibition by NADH. In previous crystallographic work, we defined the NADH binding sites, identifying nine amino acids whose side chains were proposed to make hydrogen bonds with the NADH molecule. Here, we describe the functional properties of nine sequence variants, in which these have been replaced by nonbonding residues. All of the variants show some changes in NADH binding and inhibition and small but significant changes in kinetic parameters for catalysis. In three cases, Y145A, R163L, and K167A, NADH inhibition has become extremely weak. We have used nanospray/time-of-flight mass spectrometry, under non-denaturing conditions, to show that two of these, R163L and K167A, do not form hexamers in response to NADH binding, unlike the wild type enzyme. One variant, R109L, shows tighter NADH binding. We have crystallized this variant and determined its structure, with and without bound NADH. Unexpectedly, the greatest structural changes in the R109L variant are in two regions outside the NADH binding site, both of which, in wild type citrate synthase, have unusually high mobilities as measured by crystallographic thermal factors. In the R109L variant, both regions (residues 260 -311 and 316-342) are much less mobile and have rearranged significantly. We argue that these two regions are elements in the path of communication between the NADH binding sites and the active sites and are centrally involved in the regulatory conformational change in E. coli citrate synthase.},

abstract = {Localization of signaling complexes to specific microdomains coordinates signal transduction at the plasma membrane. Using immunogold electron microscopy of plasma membrane sheets coupled with spatial point pattern analysis, we have visualized morphologically featureless microdomains, including lipid rafts, in situ and at high resolution. We find that an inner-plasma membrane lipid raft marker displays cholesterol-dependent clustering in microdomains with a mean diameter of 44 nm that occupy 35{\%} of the cell surface. Cross-linking an outer-leaflet raft protein results in the redistribution of inner leaflet rafts, but they retain their modular structure. Analysis of Ras microlocalization shows that inactive H-ras is distributed between lipid rafts and a cholesterol-independent microdomain. Conversely, activated H-ras and K-ras reside predominantly in nonoverlapping, cholesterol-independent microdomains. Galectin-1 stabilizes the association of activated H-ras with these nonraft microdomains, whereas K-ras clustering is supported by farnesylation, but not geranylgeranylation. These results illustrate that the inner plasma membrane comprises a complex mosaic of discrete microdomains. Differential spatial localization within this framework can likely account for the distinct signal outputs from the highly homologous Ras proteins.},

abstract = {Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is a mechanism identified in Escherichia coli by which bacteria expressing two-partner secretion proteins encoded by cdiA and cdiB bind to BamA in the outer membranes of target cells and inhibit their growth. A third gene in the cluster, cdiI, encodes a small protein that is necessary and sufficient to confer immunity to CDI, thereby preventing cells expressing the cdiBA genes from inhibiting their own growth. In this study, the cdiI gene was placed under araBAD promoter control to modulate levels of the immunity protein and thereby induce CDI by removal of arabinose. This CDI autoinhibition system was used for metabolic analyses of a single population of E. coli cells undergoing CDI. Contact-inhibited cells showed altered cell morphology, including the presence of filaments. Notably, CDI was reversible, as evidenced by resumption of cell growth and normal cellular morphology following induction of the CdiI immunity protein. Recovery of cells from CDI also required an energy source. Cells undergoing CDI showed a significant, reversible downregulation of metabolic parameters, including aerobic respiration, proton motive force (Deltap), and steady-state ATP levels. It is unclear whether the decrease in respiration and/or Deltap is directly involved in growth inhibition, but a role for ATP in the CDI mechanism was ruled out using an atp mutant. Consistent with the observed decrease in Deltap, the phage shock response was induced in cells undergoing CDI but not in recovering cells, based on analysis of levels of pspA mRNA.},

We confirm that the microbiome strongly impacts on the metabolism of bile acids through the enterohepatic cycle and gut metabolism (higher levels of phosphocholine and glycine in GF liver and marked higher levels of bile acids in three gut compartments). Furthermore we demonstrate that (1) well-defined metabolic differences exist in all examined compartments between the metabotypes of GF and conventional mice: bacterial co-metabolic products such as hippurate (urine) and 5-aminovalerate (colon epithelium) were found at reduced concentrations, whereas raffinose was only detected in GF colonic profiles. (2) The microbiome also influences kidney homeostasis with elevated levels of key cell volume regulators (betaine, choline, myo-inositol and so on) observed in GF kidneys. (3) Gut microbiota modulate metabotype expression at both local (gut) and global (biofluids, kidney, liver) system levels and hence influence the responses to a variety of dietary modulation and drug exposures relevant to personalized health-care investigations.},

FtsZ is a potential drug target, as illustrated by the small-molecule cell-cycle inhibitor and antibacterial agent PC190723 that targets FtsZ. We demonstrate that PC190723 negatively modulates Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ polymerization cooperativity as reflected in polymerization at lower concentrations without a defined critical concentration. The crystal structure of the S. aureus FtsZ-PC190723 complex shows a domain movement that would stabilize the FtsZ protofilament over the monomeric state, with the conformational change mediated from the GTP-binding site to the C-terminal domain via helix 7. Together, the results reveal the molecular mechanism of FtsZ modulation by PC190723 and a conformational switch to the high-affinity state that enables polymer assembly.},

abstract = {In flies, scute (sc) works with its paralogs in the achaete-scute-complex (ASC) to direct neuronal development. However, in the family Drosophilidae, sc also acquired a role in the primary event of sex determination, X chromosome counting, by becoming an X chromosome signal element (XSE)-an evolutionary step shown here to have occurred after sc diverged from its closest paralog, achaete (ac). Two temperature-sensitive alleles, sc(sisB2) and sc(sisB3), which disrupt only sex determination, were recovered in a powerful F1 genetic selection and used to investigate how sc was recruited to the sex-determination pathway. sc(sisB2) revealed 3' nontranscribed regulatory sequences likely to be involved. The sc(sisB2) lesion abolished XSE activity when combined with mutations engineered in a sequence upstream of all XSEs. In contrast, changes in Sc protein sequence seem not to have been important for recruitment. The observation that the other new allele, sc(sisB3), eliminates the C-terminal half of Sc without affecting neurogenesis and that sc(sisB1), the most XSE-specific allele previously available, is a nonsense mutant, would seem to suggest the opposite, but we show that housefly Sc can substitute for fruit fly Sc in sex determination, despite lacking Drosophilidae-specific conserved residues in its C-terminal half. Lack of synergistic lethality among mutations in sc, twist, and dorsal argue against a proposed role for sc in mesoderm formation that had seemed potentially relevant to sex-pathway recruitment. The screen that yielded new sc alleles also generated autosomal duplications that argue against the textbook view that fruit fly sex signal evolution recruited a set of autosomal signal elements comparable to the XSEs.},

RpoS-dependent gene expression leads to general stress resistance of cells. During rapid growth, RpoS translation is inhibited and any RpoS protein that is synthesized is rapidly degraded. The complex transition from exponential growth to stationary phase has been partially dissected by analyzing the induction of RpoS after specific stress treatments. Different stress conditions lead to induction of specific sRNAs that stimulate RpoS translation or to induction of small-protein antiadaptors that stabilize the protein. Recent progress has led to a better, but still far from complete, understanding of how stresses lead to RpoS induction and what RpoS-dependent genes help the cell deal with the stress.},

Most eukaryotic species have two different types of condensin complexes, known as condensins I and II, that fulfill nonoverlapping functions and are subjected to differential regulation during mitosis and meiosis. Recent studies revealed that the two complexes contribute to a wide variety of interphase chromosome functions, such as gene regulation, recombination, and repair. Also emerging are their cell type- and tissue-specific functions and relevance to human disease. Biochemical and structural analyses of eukaryotic and bacterial condensins steadily uncover the mechanisms of action of this class of highly sophisticated molecular machines. Future studies on condensins will not only enhance our understanding of chromosome architecture and dynamics, but also help address a previously underappreciated yet profound set of questions in chromosome biology.},

@article{Dennis2004,
abstract = {The first part of this review contains an overview of the various contributions and models relating to the control of rRNA synthesis reported over the last 45 years. The second part describes a systems biology approach to identify the factors and effectors that control the interactions between RNA polymerase and rRNA (rrn) promoters of Escherichia coli bacteria during exponential growth in different media. This analysis is based on measurements of absolute rrn promoter activities as transcripts per minute per promoter in bacterial strains either deficient or proficient in the synthesis of the factor Fis and/or the effector ppGpp. These absolute promoter activities are evaluated in terms of rrn promoter strength (V(max)/K(m)) and free RNA polymerase concentrations. Three major conclusions emerge from this evaluation. First, the rrn promoters are not saturated with RNA polymerase. As a consequence, changes in the concentration of free RNA polymerase contribute to changes in rrn promoter activities. Second, rrn P2 promoter strength is not specifically regulated during exponential growth at different rates; its activity changes only when the concentration of free RNA polymerase changes. Third, the effector ppGpp reduces the strength of the rrn P1 promoter both directly and indirectly by reducing synthesis of the stimulating factor Fis. This control of rrn P1 promoter strength forms part of a larger feedback loop that adjusts the synthesis of ribosomes to the availability of amino acids via amino acid-dependent control of ppGpp accumulation.},

abstract = {The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression effect in Escherichia coli is among the most intensely studied regulatory processes in biology. However, the physiological function(s) of cAMP signalling and its molecular triggers remain elusive. Here we use a quantitative physiological approach to show that cAMP signalling tightly coordinates the expression of catabolic proteins with biosynthetic and ribosomal proteins, in accordance with the cellular metabolic needs during exponential growth. The expression of carbon catabolic genes increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex molecular signalling networks.},

abstract = {Positive feedback plays a key role in the ability of signaling molecules to form highly localized clusters in the membrane or cytosol of cells. Such clustering can occur in the absence of localizing mechanisms such as pre-existing spatial cues, diffusional barriers, or molecular cross-linking. What prevents positive feedback from amplifying inevitable biological noise when an un-clustered "off" state is desired? And, what limits the spread of clusters when an "on" state is desired? Here, we show that a minimal positive feedback circuit provides the general principle for both suppressing and amplifying noise: below a critical density of signaling molecules, clustering switches off; above this threshold, highly localized clusters are recurrently generated. Clustering occurs only in the stochastic regime, suggesting that finite sizes of molecular populations cannot be ignored in signal transduction networks. The emergence of a dominant cluster for finite numbers of molecules is partly a phenomenon of random sampling, analogous to the fixation or loss of neutral mutations in finite populations. We refer to our model as the "neutral drift polarity model." Regulating the density of signaling molecules provides a simple mechanism for a positive feedback circuit to robustly switch between clustered and un-clustered states. The intrinsic ability of positive feedback both to create and suppress clustering is a general mechanism that could operate within diverse biological networks to create dynamic spatial organization.},

We analyzed the probabilistic and transient differentiation of Bacillus subtilis cells into the state of competence. A few key parameters independently tuned the frequency of initiation and the duration of competence episodes and allowed the circuit to access different dynamic regimes, including oscillation. Altering circuit architecture showed that the duration of competence events can be made more precise. We used an experimental method to reduce global cellular noise and showed that noise levels are correlated with frequency of differentiation events. Together, the data reveal a noise-dependent circuit that is remarkably resilient and tunable in terms of its dynamic behavior.},

abstract = {Ras family small GTPases assume two interconverting conformations, "inactive" state 1 and "active" state 2, in their GTP-bound forms. Here, to clarify the mechanism of state transition, we have carried out x-ray crystal structure analyses of a series of mutant H-Ras and M-Ras in complex with guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate (GppNHp), representing various intermediate states of the transition. Crystallization of H-RasT35S-GppNHp enables us to solve the first complete tertiary structure of H-Ras state 1 possessing two surface pockets unseen in the state 2 or H-Ras-GDP structure. Moreover, determination of the two distinct crystal structures of H-RasT35S-GppNHp, showing prominent polysterism in the switch I and switch II regions, reveals a pivotal role of the guanine nucleotide-mediated interaction between the two switch regions and its rearrangement by a nucleotide positional change in the state 2 to state 1 transition. Furthermore, the (31)P NMR spectra and crystal structures of the GppNHp-bound forms of M-Ras mutants, carrying various H-Ras-type amino acid substitutions, also reveal the existence of a surface pocket in state 1 and support a similar mechanism based on the nucleotide-mediated interaction and its rearrangement in the state 1 to state 2 transition. Intriguingly, the conformational changes accompanying the state transition mimic those that occurred upon GDP/GTP exchange, indicating a common mechanistic basis inherent in the high flexibility of the switch regions. Collectively, these results clarify the structural features distinguishing the two states and provide new insights into the molecular basis for the state transition of Ras protein.},

abstract = {Cellular metabolism converts available nutrients into usable energy and biomass precursors. The process is regulated to facilitate efficient nutrient use and metabolic homeostasis. Feedback inhibition of the first committed step of a pathway by its final product is a classical means of controlling biosynthesis. In a canonical example, the first committed enzyme in the pyrimidine pathway in Escherichia coli is allosterically inhibited by cytidine triphosphate. The physiological consequences of disrupting this regulation, however, have not been previously explored. Here we identify an alternative regulatory strategy that enables precise control of pyrimidine pathway end-product levels, even in the presence of dysregulated biosynthetic flux. The mechanism involves cooperative feedback regulation of the near-terminal pathway enzyme uridine monophosphate kinase. Such feedback leads to build-up of the pathway intermediate uridine monophosphate, which is in turn degraded by a conserved phosphatase, here termed UmpH, with previously unknown physiological function. Such directed overflow metabolism allows homeostasis of uridine triphosphate and cytidine triphosphate levels at the expense of uracil excretion and slower growth during energy limitation. Disruption of the directed overflow regulatory mechanism impairs growth in pyrimidine-rich environments. Thus, pyrimidine homeostasis involves dual regulatory strategies, with classical feedback inhibition enhancing metabolic efficiency and directed overflow metabolism ensuring end-product homeostasis.},

abstract = {Quantitative analysis of biochemical networks often requires consideration of both spatial and stochastic aspects of chemical processes. Despite significant progress in the field, it is still computationally prohibitive to simulate systems involving many reactants or complex geometries using a microscopic framework that includes the finest length and time scales of diffusion-limited molecular interactions. For this reason, spatially or temporally discretized simulations schemes are commonly used when modeling intracellular reaction networks. The challenge in defining such coarse-grained models is to calculate the correct probabilities of reaction given the microscopic parameters and the uncertainty in the molecular positions introduced by the spatial or temporal discretization. In this paper we have solved this problem for the spatially discretized Reaction-Diffusion Master Equation; this enables a seamless and physically consistent transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic frameworks of reaction-diffusion kinetics. We exemplify the use of the methods by showing that a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation motif, commonly observed in eukaryotic signaling pathways, is predicted to display fluctuations that depend on the geometry of the system.},

abstract = {Transcription in eukaryotic cells has been described as quantal, with pulses of messenger RNA produced in a probabilistic manner. This description reflects the inherently stochastic nature of gene expression, known to be a major factor in the heterogeneous response of individual cells within a clonal population to an inducing stimulus. Here we show in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that stochasticity (noise) arising from transcription contributes significantly to the level of heterogeneity within a eukaryotic clonal population, in contrast to observations in prokaryotes, and that such noise can be modulated at the translational level. We use a stochastic model of transcription initiation specific to eukaryotes to show that pulsatile mRNA production, through reinitiation, is crucial for the dependence of noise on transcriptional efficiency, highlighting a key difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic sources of noise. Furthermore, we explore the propagation of noise in a gene cascade network and demonstrate experimentally that increased noise in the transcription of a regulatory protein leads to increased cell-cell variability in the target gene output, resulting in prolonged bistable expression states. This result has implications for the role of noise in phenotypic variation and cellular differentiation.},

Bacterial division is often assumed to be controlled in this way, but experimental evidence to support this assumption is still lacking. Theoretical arguments show that size control is required to maintain size homeostasis in the case of exponential growth of individual cells. Nevertheless, if the growth law deviates slightly from exponential for very small cells, homeostasis can be maintained with a simple âtimer' triggering division. Therefore, deciding whether division control in bacteria relies on a âtimer' or âsizer' mechanism requires quantitative comparisons between models and data.$\backslash$nPMID: 24580833},

Thus, the use of this system which can be efficiently and rapidly turned on and off allows the study of important aspects of bacterial physiology in a very simple manner and without changes of temperature.

abstract = {In Escherichia coli FtsZ organizes into a cytoskeletal ring structure, the Z ring, which effects cell division. FtsZ is a GTPase, but the free energy of GTP hydrolysis does not appear to be used for generation of the constriction force, leaving open the question of the function of the GTPase activity of FtsZ. Here we study the mechanism by which SulA, an inhibitor of FtsZ induced during the SOS response, inhibits FtsZ function. We studied the effects of SulA on the in vitro activities of FtsZ, on Z rings in vivo, and on a kinetic model for FtsZ polymerization in silico. We found that the binding of SulA to FtsZ is necessary but not sufficient for inhibition of polymerization, since the assembly of FtsZ polymers in the absence of the GTPase activity was not inhibited by SulA. We developed a new model for FtsZ polymerization that accounts for the cooperativity of FtsZ and could account for cooperativity observed in other linear polymers. When SulA was included in the kinetic scheme, simulations revealed that SulA with strong affinity for FtsZ delayed, but did not prevent, the assembly of polymers when they were not hydrolyzing GTP. Furthermore, the simulations indicated that SulA controls the assembly of FtsZ by binding to a polymerization-competent form of the FtsZ molecule and preventing it from participating in assembly. In vivo stoichiometry of the disruption of Z rings by SulA suggests that FtsZ may undergo two cooperative transitions in forming the Z ring.},

abstract = {The taxonomic class of oomycetes contains numerous pathogens of plants and animals but is related to nonpathogenic diatoms and brown algae. Oomycetes have flexible genomes comprising large gene families that play roles in pathogenicity. The evolutionary processes that shaped the gene content have not yet been studied by applying systematic tree reconciliation of the phylome of these species. We analyzed evolutionary dynamics of ten Stramenopiles. Gene gains, duplications, and losses were inferred by tree reconciliation of 18,459 gene trees constituting the phylome with a highly supported species phylogeny. We reconstructed a strikingly large last common ancestor of the Stramenopiles that contained {\~{}}10,000 genes. Throughout evolution, the genomes of pathogenic oomycetes have constantly gained and lost genes, though gene gains through duplications outnumber the losses. The branch leading to the plant pathogenic Phytophthora genus was identified as a major transition point characterized by increased frequency of duplication events that has likely driven the speciation within this genus. Large gene families encoding different classes of enzymes associated with pathogenicity such as glycoside hydrolases are formed by complex and distinct patterns of duplications and losses leading to their expansion in extant oomycetes. This study unveils the large-scale evolutionary dynamics that shaped the genomes of pathogenic oomycetes. By the application of phylogenetic based analyses methods, it provides additional insights that shed light on the complex history of oomycete genome evolution and the emergence of large gene families characteristic for this important class of pathogens.},

abstract = {Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) systems encode polymorphic toxin/immunity proteins that mediate competition between neighboring bacterial cells. We present crystal structures of CDI toxin/immunity complexes from Escherichia coli EC869 and Burkholderia pseudomallei 1026b. Despite sharing little sequence identity, the toxin domains are structurally similar and have homology to endonucleases. The EC869 toxin is a Zn(2+)-dependent DNase capable of completely degrading the genomes of target cells, whereas the Bp1026b toxin cleaves the aminoacyl acceptor stems of tRNA molecules. Each immunity protein binds and inactivates its cognate toxin in a unique manner. The EC869 toxin/immunity complex is stabilized through an unusual beta-augmentation interaction. In contrast, the Bp1026b immunity protein exploits shape and charge complementarity to occlude the toxin active site. These structures represent the initial glimpse into the CDI toxin/immunity network, illustrating how sequence-diverse toxins adopt convergent folds yet retain distinct binding interactions with cognate immunity proteins. Moreover, we present visual demonstration of CDI toxin delivery into a target cell.},

In this approach, aggregation (or clustering) is identified if the average number of proteins within a distance r of another protein is statistically greater than that expected for a random distribution. However, it is not entirely clear how the function may be used to quantitatively determine the size of domains in which clustering occurs. Here, we evaluate the extent to which the domain radius can be determined by different interpretations of Ripley's K-statistic in a theoretical, idealized context. We also evaluate the measures for noisy experimental data and use Monte Carlo simulations to separate the effects of different types of experimental noise. We find that the radius of maximal aggregation approximates the domain radius, while identifying the domain boundary with the minimum of the derivative of H(r) is highly accurate in idealized conditions. The accuracy of both measures is impacted by the noise present in experimental data; for example, here, the presence of a large fraction of particles distributed as monomers and interdomain interactions. These findings help to delineate the limitations and potential of Ripley's K in real-life scenarios.},

We analyzed the ability of temporal signal modulation--that is, dynamics--to reduce noise-induced information loss. In the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), calcium (Ca(2+)), and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-$\kappa$B) pathways, response dynamics resulted in significantly greater information transmission capacities compared to nondynamic responses. Theoretical analysis demonstrated that signaling dynamics has a key role in overcoming extrinsic noise. Experimental measurements of information transmission in the ERK network under varying signal-to-noise levels confirmed our predictions and showed that signaling dynamics mitigate, and can potentially eliminate, extrinsic noise-induced information loss. By curbing the information-degrading effects of cell-to-cell variability, dynamic responses substantially increase the accuracy of biochemical signaling networks.},

Mitotic chromosomal compaction or 'condensation' is functionally linked to resolution of chromosomal intertwines, transcriptional shut-off and complete segregation of chromosomes. At present, understanding of the molecular events required to convert interphase chromatin into mitotic chromosomes is limited. Here, we review recent advances in the field, focusing on potential chromosomal compaction mechanisms and their importance to chromosome segregation. We propose a model of how metaphase chromosomes could be shaped based on the enzymatic activities of condensin and topoisomerase II in overwinding and relaxation of the DNA fiber during mitosis. We suggest that condensin overwinding is an important requirement for intertwine resolution by topoisomerase II and, together with the inhibition of transcription, contributes to cytological mitotic chromosome appearance or 'condensation'.},

Immunoblot studies of cells transformed by overexpression of c-H-ras indicated that H-Ras protein was present in both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts, suggesting a possible correlation of nuclear H-Ras and cellular transformation. Unexpectedly, additional studies revealed that H-Ras protein was also present in the nuclei of nontransformed and primary mouse cells, which do not overexpress H-Ras. Mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells, L cells, and a primary fibroblast line all had H-Ras present in both cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts. Nuclear extracts of cells synchronized by growth without serum displayed an increasing amount of H-Ras and cyclin D1 as cells grew after serum addition. Treatment with farnesyltransferase inhibitor caused loss of H-Ras from the nucleus. Immunofluorescence in situ studies of nuclei from synchronized cultures showed that H-Ras protein appeared in and disappeared from the nuclei as the cells moved through the growth cycle. This cycling occurred in both nontransformed and ras-transformed cells. Flow cytometry measurements on parallel cultures revealed that the time point at which the greatest percentage of cells were in S phase, for each line, corresponded to appearance of a noticeably stronger in situ signal for H-Ras. H-Ras may participate in nuclear signaling pathways associated with replication in addition to its cytoplasmic signaling functions.},

abstract = {Cyclic adenosine 5'-phosphate (cAMP) is a global regulator of gene expression in Escherichia coli. Despite decades of intensive study, the quantitative effect and regulatory function of cAMP remain the subjects of considerable debate. Here, we analyse the data in the literature to show that: (a) In carbon-limited cultures (including cultures limited by glucose), cAMP is at near-saturation levels with respect to expression of several catabolic promoters (including lac, ara and gal). It follows that cAMP receptor protein (CRP) cAMP-mediated regulation cannot account for the strong repression of these operons in the presence of glucose. (b) The cAMP levels in carbon-excess cultures are substantially lower than those observed in carbon-limited cultures under these conditions, the expression of catabolic promoters is very sensitive to variation of cAMP levels. (c)=CRPcAMP invariably activates the expression of catabolic promoters, but it appears to inhibit the expression of anabolic promoters. (d) These results suggest that the physiological function of cAMP is to maintain homeostatic energy levels. In carbon-limited cultures, growth is limited by the supply of energy; the cAMP levels therefore increase to enhance energy accumulation by activating the catabolic promoters and inhibiting the anabolic promoters. Conversely, in carbonexcess cultures, characterized by the availability of excess energy, the cAMP levels decrease in order to depress energy accumulation by inhibiting the catabolic promoters and activating the anabolic promoters.},

Nonlinear interaction among components is sufficiently complex that mathematical models are required to elucidate their elusive integrated behavior. Although natural and synthetic oscillators exhibit common architectures, there are numerous differences that are poorly understood. Utilizing synthetic biology to uncover basic principles of simpler circuits is a way to advance understanding of natural circadian clocks and rhythms. Following this strategy, we address the following questions: What are the implications of different architectures and molecular modes of transcriptional control for the phenotypic repertoire of genetic oscillators? Are there designs that are more realizable or robust? We compare synthetic oscillators involving one of three architectures and various combinations of the two modes of transcriptional control using a methodology that provides three innovations: a rigorous definition of phenotype, a procedure for deconstructing complex systems into qualitatively distinct phenotypes, and a graphical representation for illuminating the relationship between genotype, environment, and the qualitatively distinct phenotypes of a system. These methods provide a global perspective on the behavioral repertoire, facilitate comparisons of alternatives, and assist the rational design of synthetic gene circuitry. In particular, the results of their application here reveal distinctive phenotypes for several designs that have been studied experimentally as well as a best design among the alternatives that has yet to be constructed and tested.},

abstract = {Many cells undergo symmetry-breaking polarization toward a randomly oriented "front" in the absence of spatial cues. In budding yeast, such polarization involves a positive feedback loop that enables amplification of stochastically arising clusters of polarity factors. Previous mathematical modeling suggested that, if more than one cluster were amplified, the clusters would compete for limiting resources and the largest would "win," explaining why yeast cells always make one and only one bud. Here, using imaging with improved spatiotemporal resolution, we show the transient coexistence of multiple clusters during polarity establishment, as predicted by the model. Unexpectedly, we also find that initial polarity factor clustering is oscillatory, revealing the presence of a negative feedback loop that disperses the factors. Mathematical modeling predicts that negative feedback would confer robustness to the polarity circuit and make the kinetics of competition between polarity factor clusters relatively insensitive to polarity factor concentration. These predictions are confirmed experimentally. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Cyclic GMP, normally an ineffective activator of CRP+, can stimulate these mutant CRP*s to permit greater lac expression in vivo. Cyclic AMP binding to the amino-terminal domain of CRP+ induces an allosteric transition that changes the DNA-binding property of the carboxy domain. The CRP* phenotype is caused by substitution of amino acids with bulkier side chains in the D alpha-helix of the protein's carboxy domain, near the hinge connecting the two domains. These results are consistent with a model in which the mutant CRP*s assume, in part, a conformation normally evoked only by cAMP binding: one in which the relative orientation of the C, D, and F alpha-helices is altered. We define precisely the amino acids of these alpha-helices that interact to cause the allosteric shift.},

Here we present a fluorescence recovery after photobleaching technique to determine the lifetime of protein complexes on intracellular vesicles. We use Bayesian inference based on a model that includes the diffusion of cytosolic proteins and their interaction with membrane-bound receptors. Our analysis is general: we incorporate prior information on protein diffusion, measurement error in determining fluorescence intensities, corrections for photobleaching, and variation in the concentration of receptors between vesicles. We apply our method to the complexes formed on endosomes by G-protein-coupled receptors and the protein beta-arrestin. The lifetime of these complexes determines the recycling rate of the receptors. We find in mammalian cells that the bradykinin type 2 receptor and beta-arrestin2 complex has a lifetime of approximately 2 min, while the angiotensin II type 1A receptor and beta-arrestin2 complex has a lifetime of approximately 6 min. As well as allowing quantitative comparisons between experiments, our method provides in vivo parameters for systems biology simulations of signaling networks.},

We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise.

abstract = {Mitotic cell death (MCD) is a prominent but poorly defined form of death that stems from aberrant mitosis. One of the early steps in MCD is premature mitosis and uneven chromatin condensation (UCC). The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is currently unknown. In this study, we show that DNA damage in cells with a compromised p53-mediated G2/M checkpoint triggers the unscheduled activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), activation and chromatin loading of the condensin I complex, and UCC followed by the appearance of multimicronucleated cells, which is evidence of MCD. We demonstrate that these processes engage some of the players of normal mitotic chromatin packaging but not those that drive the apoptotic chromatin condensation. Our findings establish a link between the induction of DNA damage and mitotic abnormalities (UCC) through the unscheduled activation of Cdk1 and recruitment of condensin I. These results demonstrate a clear distinction between the mechanisms that drive MCD-associated and apoptosis-related chromatin condensation and provide mechanistic insights and new readouts for a major cell death process in treated tumors.},

How these complexes interact to promote effector secretion and cell targeting remains a major question in the field. As a contact-dependent pathway with specific cellular targets, the T6SS is subject to tight regulation. Thus, the identification of regulatory elements that control T6S expression continues to shape our understanding of the environmental circumstances relevant to its function.

abstract = {Gene expression is a stochastic, or "noisy," process. This noise comes about in two ways. The inherent stochasticity of biochemical processes such as transcription and translation generates "intrinsic" noise. In addition, fluctuations in the amounts or states of other cellular components lead indirectly to variation in the expression of a particular gene and thus represent "extrinsic" noise. Here, we show how the total variation in the level of expression of a given gene can be decomposed into its intrinsic and extrinsic components. We demonstrate theoretically that simultaneous measurement of two identical genes per cell enables discrimination of these two types of noise. Analytic expressions for intrinsic noise are given for a model that involves all the major steps in transcription and translation. These expressions give the sensitivity to various parameters, quantify the deviation from Poisson statistics, and provide a way of fitting experiment. Transcription dominates the intrinsic noise when the average number of proteins made per mRNA transcript is greater than approximately 2. Below this number, translational effects also become important. Gene replication and cell division, included in the model, cause protein numbers to tend to a limit cycle. We calculate a general form for the extrinsic noise and illustrate it with the particular case of a single fluctuating extrinsic variable-a repressor protein, which acts on the gene of interest. All results are confirmed by stochastic simulation using plausible parameters for Escherichia coli.},

abstract = {Little was known about the development of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiota, until recently, because of difficulties in obtaining sufficient sequence information from enough people or time points. Now, with decreased costs of DNA sequencing and improved bioinformatic tools, we can compare GI tract bacterial communities among individuals, of all ages from infancy to adulthood. Some key recent findings are that the initial bacterial community, even in the GI tract, depends strongly on delivery mode; that the process of early development of the microbiota is highly unstable and idiosyncratic; that the microbiota differs considerably among children from different countries; and that older adults have substantially different GI tract communities than younger adults, indicating that the GI tract microbiota can change throughout life. We relate these observations to different models of evolution including the evolution of senescence and suggest that probiotics be selected based on patient age. Studies of the microbiota in older people might tell us which probiotics could increase longevity. Drug metabolism varies among individuals with different microbial communities, so age- and region-specific clinical trials are required to ensure safety and efficacy. ?? 2011 AGA Institute.},

abstract = {Cells employ a myriad of signaling circuits to detect environmental signals and drive specific gene expression responses. A common motif in these circuits is inducible auto-activation: a transcription factor that activates its own transcription upon activation by a ligand or by post-transcriptional modification. Examples range from the two-component signaling systems in bacteria and plants to the genetic circuits of animal viruses such as HIV. We here present a theoretical study of such circuits, based on analytical calculations, numerical computations, and simulation. Our results reveal several surprising characteristics. They show that auto-activation can drastically enhance the sensitivity of the circuit's response to input signals: even without molecular cooperativity, an ultra-sensitive threshold response can be obtained. However, the increased sensitivity comes at a cost: auto-activation tends to severely slow down the speed of induction, a stochastic effect that was strongly underestimated by earlier deterministic models. This slow-induction effect again requires no molecular cooperativity and is intimately related to the bimodality recently observed in non-cooperative auto-activation circuits. These phenomena pose strong constraints on the use of auto-activation in signaling networks. To achieve both a high sensitivity and a rapid induction, an inducible auto-activation circuit is predicted to acquire low cooperativity and low fold-induction.

abstract = {The gene for the major phosphofructokinase enzyme in Escherichia coli, pfkA, has been sequenced. Comparison of the amino acid sequence with other phosphofructokinases showed that this enzyme is related to the Bacillus stearothermophilus and rabbit muscle enzymes, but is different from the second, minor phosphofructokinase found in E. coli. The region which has been sequenced comprises the complete pfkA--tpi interval on the E. coli genetic map. Two other genes have been identified from the nucleotide sequence: a gene for a periplasmic sulphate-binding protein, sbp, and for a membrane-bound enzyme, CDP-diglyceride hydrolase, cdh. This establishes the complete gene arrangement in this region as pfkA-sbp-cdh-tpi. The pfkA gene has been subcloned into a high-copy-number plasmid under the control of a strong, chimaeric promoter which arose as an artefact in the construction of the plasmid gene bank from which the original pfkA recombinant was isolated. A specialised recombinant has been constructed which carries a 1.4 X 10(3)-nucleotide insert containing just the pfkA gene flanked by two HindIII recognition sites providing a simple system for the recloning of this gene into different vectors. This recombinant expresses the enzyme at high levels (40-50{\%} of total cell protein is active, soluble phosphofructokinase). This expression system is now being used to study the enzyme using 'reverse genetics'.},

abstract = {Methods are presented for simulating chemical reaction networks with a spatial resolution that is accurate to nearly the size scale of individual molecules. Using an intuitive picture of chemical reaction systems, each molecule is treated as a point-like particle that diffuses freely in three-dimensional space. When a pair of reactive molecules collide, such as an enzyme and its substrate, a reaction occurs and the simulated reactants are replaced by products. Achieving accurate bimolecular reaction kinetics is surprisingly difficult, requiring a careful consideration of reaction processes that are often overlooked. This includes whether the rate of a reaction is at steady-state and the probability that multiple reaction products collide with each other to yield a back reaction. Inputs to the simulation are experimental reaction rates, diffusion coefficients and the simulation time step. From these are calculated the simulation parameters, including the 'binding radius' and the 'unbinding radius', where the former defines the separation for a molecular collision and the latter is the initial separation between a pair of reaction products. Analytic solutions are presented for some simulation parameters while others are calculated using look-up tables. Capabilities of these methods are demonstrated with simulations of a simple bimolecular reaction and the Lotka-Volterra system.},

Divisome assembly occurs in two steps and involves multiple interactions between more than 20 essential and accessory cell division proteins. Well before constriction and while the cell is still elongating, the tubulin-like FtsZ and early cell division proteins form a ring-like structure at mid-cell. Cell division starts once certain peptidoglycan enzymes and their activators have moved to the FtsZ-ring. Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli simultaneously synthesize and cleave the septum peptidoglycan during division leading to a constriction. The outer membrane constricts together with the peptidoglycan layer with the help of the transenvelope spanning Tol-Pal system.},

abstract = {K-Ras functions as a critical node in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that regulates key cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Following growth factor receptor activation K-Ras.GTP forms nanoclusters on the plasma membrane through interaction with the scaffold protein galectin-3. The generation of nanoclusters is essential for high fidelity signal transduction via the MAPK pathway. To explore the mechanisms underlying K-Ras.GTP nanocluster formation, we developed a mathematical model of K-Ras-galectin-3 interactions. We designed a computational method to calculate protein collision rates based on experimentally determined protein diffusion rates and diffusion mechanisms and used a genetic algorithm to search the values of key model parameters. The optimal estimated model parameters were validated using experimental data. The resulting model accurately replicates critical features of K-Ras nanoclustering, including a fixed ratio of clustered K-Ras.GTP to monomeric K-Ras.GTP that is independent of the concentration of K-Ras.GTP. The model reproduces experimental results showing that the cytosolic level of galectin-3 determines the magnitude of the K-Ras.GTP clustered fraction and illustrates that nanoclustering is regulated by key nonequilibrium processes. Our kinetic model identifies a potential biophysical mechanism for K-Ras nanoclustering and suggests general principles that may be relevant for other plasma-membrane-localized proteins.},

abstract = {Cellular metabolism converts available nutrients into usable energy and biomass precursors. The process is regulated to facilitate efficient nutrient use and metabolic homeostasis. Feedback inhibition of the first committed step of a pathway by its final product is a classical means of controlling biosynthesis. In a canonical example, the first committed enzyme in the pyrimidine pathway in Escherichia coli is allosterically inhibited by cytidine triphosphate. The physiological consequences of disrupting this regulation, however, have not been previously explored. Here we identify an alternative regulatory strategy that enables precise control of pyrimidine pathway end-product levels, even in the presence of dysregulated biosynthetic flux. The mechanism involves cooperative feedback regulation of the near-terminal pathway enzyme uridine monophosphate kinase. Such feedback leads to build-up of the pathway intermediate uridine monophosphate, which is in turn degraded by a conserved phosphatase, here termed UmpH, with previously unknown physiological function. Such directed overflow metabolism allows homeostasis of uridine triphosphate and cytidine triphosphate levels at the expense of uracil excretion and slower growth during energy limitation. Disruption of the directed overflow regulatory mechanism impairs growth in pyrimidine-rich environments. Thus, pyrimidine homeostasis involves dual regulatory strategies, with classical feedback inhibition enhancing metabolic efficiency and directed overflow metabolism ensuring end-product homeostasis.},

@article{Alon1999,
abstract = {Networks of interacting proteins orchestrate the responses of living cells to a variety of external stimuli, but how sensitive is the functioning of these protein networks to variations in their biochemical parameters? One possibility is that to achieve appropriate function, the reaction rate constants and enzyme concentrations need to be adjusted in a precise manner, and any deviation from these 'fine-tuned' values ruins the network's performance. An alternative possibility is that key properties of biochemical networks are robust; that is, they are insensitive to the precise values of the biochemical parameters. Here we address this issue in experiments using chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, one of the best-characterized sensory systems. We focus on how response and adaptation to attractant signals vary with systematic changes in the intracellular concentration of the components of the chemotaxis network. We find that some properties, such as steady-state behaviour and adaptation time, show strong variations in response to varying protein concentrations. In contrast, the precision of adaptation is robust and does not vary with the protein concentrations. This is consistent with a recently proposed molecular mechanism for exact adaptation, where robustness is a direct consequence of the network's architecture.},

However, even genetically identical cells in identical environments display variable phenotypes. Stochastic gene expression, or gene expression "noise," has been suggested as a major source of this variability, and its physiological consequences have been topics of intense research for the last decade. Several recent studies have measured variability in protein and messenger RNA levels, and they have discovered strong connections between noise and gene regulation mechanisms. When integrated with discrete stochastic models, measurements of cell-to-cell variability provide a sensitive "fingerprint" with which to explore fundamental questions of gene regulation. In this review, we highlight several studies that used gene expression variability to develop a quantitative understanding of the mechanisms and dynamics of gene regulation.},

In addition to integral membrane proteins, a number of proteins bind to the membrane surface and associate with it. Posttranslational lipid modification is one important mechanism, by which soluble molecules develop a propensity towards the membrane and reversibly bind to it. Membrane binding by insertion of hydrophobic lipid moieties is relevant for up to 10{\%} of all cellular proteins. A particular interesting lipid-modified protein is the small GTPase Ras, which plays a key role in cellular signal transduction. Until recently, the structural basis for membrane binding of Ras was not well-defined. However, with the advent of new synthesis techniques and the advancement of several biophysical methods, a number of structural and dynamical features about membrane binding of Ras proteins have been revealed. This review will summarize the chemical biology of Ras and discuss in more detail the biophysical and structural features of the membrane bound C-terminus of the protein.},

abstract = {A complete description of protein metabolism requires knowledge of the rates of protein production and destruction within cells. Using an epitope-tagged strain collection, we measured the half-life of {\textgreater}3,750 proteins in the yeast proteome after inhibition of translation. By integrating our data with previous measurements of protein and mRNA abundance and translation rate, we provide evidence that many proteins partition into one of two regimes for protein metabolism: one optimized for efficient production or a second optimized for regulatory efficiency. Incorporation of protein half-life information into a simple quantitative model for protein production improves our ability to predict steady-state protein abundance values. Analysis of a simple dynamic protein production model reveals a remarkable correlation between transcriptional regulation and protein half-life within some groups of coregulated genes, suggesting that cells coordinate these two processes to achieve uniform effects on protein abundances. Our experimental data and theoretical analysis underscore the importance of an integrative approach to the complex interplay between protein degradation, transcriptional regulation, and other determinants of protein metabolism.},

Whether each cell's fate is determined by external direction, internal stochastic processes, or directed asymmetric division is unknown. Measurement of times to isotype switch, to develop into a plasmablast, and to divide or to die for thousands of cells indicated that each fate is pursued autonomously and stochastically. As a consequence of competition between these processes, censorship of alternative outcomes predicts intricate correlations that are observed in the data. Stochastic competition can explain how the allocation of a proportion of B cells to each cell fate is achieved. The B cell may exemplify how other complex cell differentiation systems are controlled.},

Here, we accurately measured activities of {\~{}}900 S. cerevisiae and {\~{}}1800 E. coli promoters using fluorescent reporters. We show that in both organisms 60-90{\%} of promoters change their expression between conditions by a constant global scaling factor that depends only on the conditions and not on the promoter's identity. Quantifying such global effects allows precise characterization of specific regulation-promoters deviating from the global scale line. These are organized into few functionally related groups that also adhere to scale lines and preserve their relative activities across conditions. Thus, only several scaling factors suffice to accurately describe genome-wide expression profiles across conditions. We present a parameter-free passive resource allocation model that quantitatively accounts for the global scaling factors. It suggests that many changes in expression across conditions result from global effects and not specific regulation, and provides means for quantitative interpretation of expression profiles.},

@article{Ozbudak2002,
abstract = {Stochastic mechanisms are ubiquitous in biological systems. Biochemical reactions that involve small numbers of molecules are intrinsically noisy, being dominated by large concentration fluctuations. This intrinsic noise has been implicated in the random lysis/lysogeny decision of bacteriophage-lambda, in the loss of synchrony of circadian clocks and in the decrease of precision of cell signals. We sought to quantitatively investigate the extent to which the occurrence of molecular fluctuations within single cells (biochemical noise) could explain the variation of gene expression levels between cells in a genetically identical population (phenotypic noise). We have isolated the biochemical contribution to phenotypic noise from that of other noise sources by carrying out a series of differential measurements. We varied independently the rates of transcription and translation of a single fluorescent reporter gene in the chromosome of Bacillus subtilis, and we quantitatively measured the resulting changes in the phenotypic noise characteristics. We report that of these two parameters, increased translational efficiency is the predominant source of increased phenotypic noise. This effect is consistent with a stochastic model of gene expression in which proteins are produced in random and sharp bursts. Our results thus provide the first direct experimental evidence of the biochemical origin of phenotypic noise, demonstrating that the level of phenotypic variation in an isogenic population can be regulated by genetic parameters.},

@article{Pham2001,
abstract = {MgADP binding to the allosteric site enhances the affinity of Escherichia coli phosphofructokinase (PFK) for fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P). X-ray crystallographic data indicate that MgADP interacts with the conserved glutamate at position 187 within the allosteric site through an octahedrally coordinated Mg(2+) ion [Shirakihara, Y., and Evans, P. R. (1988) J. Mol. Biol. 204, 973-994]. Lau and Fersht reported that substituting an alanine for this glutamate within the allosteric site of PFK (i.e., mutant E187A) causes MgADP to lose its allosteric effect upon Fru-6-P binding [Lau, F. T.-K., and Fersht, A. R. (1987) Nature 326, 811-812]. However, these authors later reported that MgADP inhibits Fru-6-P binding in the E187A mutant. The inhibition presumably occurs by preferential binding to the inactive (T) state complex of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux two-state model [Lau, F. T.-K., and Fersht, A. R. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 6841-6847]. The present study provides an alternative explanation of the role of MgADP in the E187A mutant. Using enzyme kinetics, steady-state fluorescence emission, and anisotropy, we performed a systematic linkage analysis of the three-ligand interaction between MgADP, Fru-6-P, and MgATP. We found that MgADP at low concentrations did not enhance or inhibit substrate binding. Anisotropy shows that MgADP binding at the allosteric site occurred even when MgADP produced no allosteric effect. However, as in the wild-type enzyme, the binding of MgADP to the active site in the mutant competitively inhibited MgATP binding and noncompetitively inhibited Fru-6-P binding. These results clarified the mechanism of a three-ligand interaction and offered a nontraditional perspective on allosteric mechanism.},

The bacterial chemotaxis pathways in E. coli and B. subtilis both regulate the same task, namely, excitation and adaptation to environmental signals. Both pathways employ many orthologous genes. Yet how these orthologs contribute to network function in each organism is different. To investigate this problem, we propose what is to our knowledge the first computational model for B. subtilis chemotaxis and compare it to previously published models for chemotaxis in E. coli. The models reveal that the core control strategy for signal processing is the same in both organisms, though in B. subtilis there are two additional feedback loops that provide an additional layer of regulation and robustness. Furthermore, the network structures are different despite the similarity of the proteins in each organism. These results demonstrate the limitations of pathway inferences based solely on homology and suggest that the control strategy is an evolutionarily conserved property.},

Notably, we have taken the step of opening up the annotation of our families to the Wikipedia community, by linking Pfam families to relevant Wikipedia pages and encouraging the Pfam and Wikipedia communities to improve and expand those pages. We continue to improve the Pfam website and add new visualizations, such as the 'sunburst' representation of taxonomic distribution of families. In this work we additionally address two topics that will be of particular interest to the Pfam community.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: In Escherichia coli, the phosphoenolpyruvate: carbohydrate phosphotransferase system acts like a sensory element which is able to measure the flux through glycolysis. Since the output of the sensor, the phosphorylated form of protein EIIA, is connected to the activity of the global transcription factor Crp, the kinetic and structural properties of the system are important for the understanding of the overall cellular behavior. RESULTS: A family of mathematical models is presented, varying with respect to their degree of complexity (number of reactions that are taken into account, number of parameters) that show a structurally and quantitatively robust behavior. The models describe a set of experimental data that relates the output of the sensor to the specific growth rate. A central element that is responsible for the structural robustness is a feed-forward loop in the glycolysis, namely the activation of the pyruvate kinase reaction by a metabolite of the upper part of the glycolysis. The robustness is shown for variations of the measured data as well as for variations of the parameters. AVAILABILITY: MATLAB files for model simulations are available on http://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/people/kre/robust/ A short description of the files provided on this site can be found in the Supporting information.},

abstract = {A fundamental characteristic of cells is their ability to regulate growth in response to changing environmental conditions. This review focuses on recent progress toward understanding the mechanisms by which bacterial growth is regulated. These phenomena include the 'viable but not culturable' (VBNC) state, in which bacterial growth becomes conditional, and 'persistence', which confers antibiotic resistance to a small fraction of bacteria in a population. Notably, at least one form of persistence appears to involve the generation of nongrowing phenotypic variants after transition through stationary phase. The possible roles of toxin-antitoxin modules in growth control are explored, as well as other mechanisms including contact-dependent growth inhibition, which regulates cellular metabolism and growth through binding to an outer membrane protein receptor.},

abstract = {Cell division in Escherichia coli begins with assembly of the tubulin-like FtsZ protein into a ring structure just underneath the cell membrane. Spatial control over Z ring assembly is achieved by two partially redundant negative regulatory systems, the Min system and nucleoid occlusion (NO), which cooperate to position the division site at midcell. In contrast to the well-studied Min system, almost nothing is known about how Z ring assembly is blocked in the vicinity of nucleoids to effect NO. Reasoning that Min function might become essential in cells impaired for NO, we screened for mutations synthetically lethal with a defective Min system (slm mutants). By using this approach, we identified SlmA (Ttk) as the first NO factor in E. coli. Our combined genetic, cytological, and biochemical results suggest that SlmA is a DNA-associated division inhibitor that is directly involved in preventing Z ring assembly on portions of the membrane surrounding the nucleoid.

abstract = {DNA supercoiling plays a fundamental role in regulating cellular activity and in the packaging of genetic material. In this communication, we analyse the effect of attractive chiral forces on the conformation of a closed circular DNA molecule, arising due to the helical patterns of charges on the DNA. We propose a model for closed loop DNA which uses the results of the recent theory of electrostatic interactions of a braid of two free-ended DNA molecules. Our model reproduces the known features of DNA supercoiling in an environment of low ionic strength. In high salt conditions, and in the presence of counterions that have high affinity to the DNA grooves, helix-specific forces significantly affect the conformation of the molecule by favouring a state characterized by a central left-handed braided section where there is close contact between distant portions of the loop. In such an environment we predict a previously unexplored possibility that nicked or topologically relaxed DNA molecules adopt a writhed state. This prediction suggests an alternative explanation for experiments in which it was assumed that the most stable topoisomer is always an open circle. Our results also give the first plausible explanation for the occurrence of tightly interwound molecules observed in cryo-electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy in a high ionic strength environment. We suggest several new experiments to test the predictions of this theory.},

A number of fluorescence reporter systems allow for monitoring the sequence of individual reaction events with a confocal microscope. When using a time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) detection scheme, additional information about the fluorescence lifetimes of the fluorophores can be obtained. We have applied a TCSPC detection scheme for studying the kinetics of $\alpha$-chymotrypsin hydrolyzing a double-substituted rhodamine 110-based fluorogenic substrate in a two-step reaction. On the basis of the lifetime information, it was possible to discriminate the intermediate and the final product. At the high substrate concentration used, only the formation of the intermediate was observed. No rebinding of the intermediate followed by rhodamine 110 formation occurred at these high concentrations. We have further found no alterations in the fluorescence lifetime of this intermediate that would indicate changes in the local environment of the fluorophore originating from strong interactions with the enzyme. Our results clearly show the power of using lifetime-resolved measurements for investigating enzymatic reactions at the single molecule level.},

abstract = {We explore the extent to which the phenotypes of individual, genetically identical cells can be controlled independently from each other using only a single homogeneous environmental input. We show that such control is theoretically impossible if restricted to a deterministic setting, but it can be achieved readily if one exploits heterogeneities introduced at the single-cell level due to stochastic fluctuations in gene regulation. Using stochastic analyses of a bistable genetic toggle switch, we develop a control strategy that maximizes the chances that a chosen cell will express one phenotype, while the rest express another. The control mechanism uses UV radiation to enhance identically protein degradation in all cells. Control of individual cells is made possible only by monitoring stochastic protein fluctuations and applying UV control at favorable times and levels. For two identical cells, our stochastic control law can drive protein expression of a chosen cell above its neighbor with a better than 99{\%} success rate. In a population of 30 identical cells, we can drive a given cell to remain consistently within the top 20{\%}. Although cellular noise typically impairs predictability for biological responses, our results show that it can also simultaneously improve controllability for those same responses.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory circuits with different architectures (patterns of regulatory interactions) can generate similar dynamics. This raises the question of why a particular circuit architecture is selected to implement a given cellular process. To investigate this problem, we compared the Bacillus subtilis circuit that regulates differentiation into the competence state to an engineered circuit with an alternative architecture (SynEx) in silico and in vivo. Time-lapse microscopy measurements showed that SynEx cells generated competence dynamics similar to native cells and reconstituted the physiology of differentiation. However, architectural differences between the circuits altered the dynamic distribution of stochastic fluctuations (noise) during circuit operation. This distinction in noise causes functional differences between the circuits by selectively controlling the timing of competence episodes and response of the system to various DNA concentrations. These results reveal a tradeoff between temporal precision and physiological response range that is controlled by distinct noise characteristics of alternative circuit architectures.},

In Bacillus subtilis, (p)ppGpp production is primarily determined by the net activity of a RelA, a bifunctional (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase and two monofunctional (p)ppGpp synthetases, YwaC and YjbM. We observe that in B. subtilis, a relA mutant grows exclusively as unchained, motile cells, phenotypes regulated by the alternative sigma factor SigD. Our data indicate that the relA mutant is trapped in a SigD ON state during exponential growth, implicating RelA and (p)ppGpp levels in the regulation of cell chaining and motility in B. subtilis. Our results also suggest that minor variations in basal (p)ppGpp levels can significantly skew developmental decision-making outcomes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding biological networks requires identifying their elementary protein interactions and establishing the timing and strength of those interactions. Fluorescence microscopy and F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) have the potential to reveal such information because they allow molecular interactions to be monitored in living cells, but it is unclear how best to analyze FRET data. Existing techniques differ in assumptions, manipulations of data and the quantities they derive. To address this variation, we have developed a versatile Bayesian analysis based on clear assumptions and systematic statistics.

RESULTS: Our algorithm infers values of the FRET efficiency and dissociation constant, Kd, between a pair of fluorescently tagged proteins. It gives a posterior probability distribution for these parameters, conveying more extensive information than single-value estimates can. The width and shape of the distribution reflects the reliability of the estimate and we used simulated data to determine how measurement noise, data quantity and fluorophore concentrations affect the inference. We are able to show why varying concentrations of donors and acceptors is necessary for estimating Kd. We further demonstrate that the inference improves if additional knowledge is available, for example of the FRET efficiency, which could be obtained from separate fluorescence lifetime measurements.

CONCLUSIONS: We present a general, systematic approach for extracting quantitative information on molecular interactions from FRET data. Our method yields both an estimate of the dissociation constant and the uncertainty associated with that estimate. The information produced by our algorithm can help design optimal experiments and is fundamental for developing mathematical models of biochemical networks.},

abstract = {For cellular biochemical reaction systems where the numbers of molecules is small, significant noise is associated with chemical reaction events. This molecular noise can give rise to behavior that is very different from the predictions of deterministic rate equation models. Unfortunately, there are few analytic methods for examining the qualitative behavior of stochastic systems. Here we describe such a method that extends deterministic analysis to include leading-order corrections due to the molecular noise. The method allows the steady-state behavior of the stochastic model to be easily computed, facilitates the mapping of stability phase diagrams that include stochastic effects, and reveals how model parameters affect noise susceptibility in a manner not accessible to numerical simulation. By way of illustration we consider two genetic circuits: a bistable positive-feedback loop and a negative-feedback oscillator. We find in the positive feedback circuit that translational activation leads to a far more stable system than transcriptional control. Conversely, in a negative-feedback loop triggered by a positive-feedback switch, the stochasticity of transcriptional control is harnessed to generate reproducible oscillations.},

We introduced helix-forming peptide linkers A(EAAAK)nA (n = 2-5) between two green fluorescent protein variants, EBFP and EGFP, and investigated their spectral properties. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer from EBFP to EGFP decreased as the length of the linkers increased. The circular dichroism spectra analysis suggested that the linkers form an alpha-helix and the alpha-helical contents increased as the length of the linkers increased. The results clearly suggested the ability of the helical linkers to control the distance and reduce the interference between the domains.

abstract = {Here we analyze the essential process of X-chromosome dosage compensation (DC) to elucidate mechanisms that control the assembly, genome-wide binding, and function of gene regulatory complexes that act over large chromosomal territories. We demonstrate that a subunit of Caenorhabditis elegans MLL/COMPASS, a gene activation complex, acts within the DC complex (DCC), a condensin complex, to target the DCC to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites for chromosome-wide reduction of gene expression. The DCC binds to two categories of sites on X: rex (recruitment element on X) sites that recruit the DCC in an autonomous, sequence-dependent manner, and dox (dependent on X) sites that reside primarily in promoters of expressed genes and bind the DCC robustly only when attached to X. We find that DC mutations that abolish rex site binding greatly reduce dox site binding but do not eliminate it. Instead, binding is diminished to the low level observed at autosomal sites in wild-type animals. Changes in DCC binding to these non-rex sites occur throughout development and correlate directly with transcriptional activity of adjacent genes. Moreover, autosomal DCC binding is enhanced by rex site binding in cis in X-autosome fusion chromosomes. Thus, dox and autosomal sites have similar binding potential but are distinguished by linkage to rex sites. We propose a model for DCC binding in which low-level DCC binding at dox sites is dictated by intrinsic properties correlated with high transcriptional activity. Sex-specific DCC recruitment to rex sites then enhances the magnitude of DCC binding to dox sites in cis, which lack high affinity for the DCC on their own. We also show that the DCC balances X-chromosome gene expression between sexes by controlling transcription.},

@article{Pogliano1994,
abstract = {We show here that the rate of protein translocation in the bacterium Escherichia coli depends on the levels of the SecD and SecF proteins in the cell. Overexpression of SecD and SecF stimulates translocation in wild type cells and improves export of proteins with mutant signal sequences. Depletion of SecD and SecF from the cell greatly reduces but does not abolish protein translocation. A secDF::kan null mutant deleted for the genes encoding both proteins is cold-sensitive for growth and protein export, has a severe export defect at 37 degrees C and is barely viable. The phenotypes of a secD null mutant and a secF null mutant are identical to the secDF::kan double null mutant. These results partially resolve the conflict between genetic studies and results from in vitro translocation systems which do not require SecD and SecF for activity, affirm the importance of these proteins to the export process, and suggest that SecD and SecF function together to stimulate protein export in a role fundamentally different from other Sec proteins. Our results provide additional support for the notion that an early step in protein export is cold-sensitive.},

abstract = {The classical model for the activation of the nucleotide exchange factor Son of sevenless (SOS) involves its recruitment to the membrane, where it engages Ras. The recent discovery that Ras*GTP is an allosteric activator of SOS indicated that the regulation of SOS is more complex than originally envisaged. We now present crystallographic and biochemical analyses of a construct of SOS that contains the Dbl homology-pleckstrin homology (DH-PH) and catalytic domains and show that the DH-PH unit blocks the allosteric binding site for Ras and suppresses the activity of SOS. SOS is dependent on Ras binding to the allosteric site for both a lower level of activity, which is a result of Ras*GDP binding, and maximal activity, which requires Ras*GTP. The action of the DH-PH unit gates a reciprocal interaction between Ras and SOS, in which Ras converts SOS from low to high activity forms as Ras*GDP is converted to Ras*GTP by SOS.},

Using the RBS Calculator, a protein coding sequence's translation rate may be rationally controlled across a 100,000+ fold range. We begin by providing an overview of the potential biotechnology applications of the RBS Calculator, including the optimization of synthetic metabolic pathways and genetic circuits. We then detail the definitions, methodologies, and algorithms behind the RBS Calculator's thermodynamic model and optimization method. Finally, we outline a protocol for precisely measuring steady-state fluorescent protein expression levels.

abstract = {Natural selection dictates that cells constantly adapt to dynamically changing environments in a context-dependent manner. Gene-regulatory networks often mediate the cellular response to perturbation, and an understanding of cellular adaptation will require experimental approaches aimed at subjecting cells to a dynamic environment that mimics their natural habitat. Here we monitor the response of Saccharomyces cerevisiae metabolic gene regulation to periodic changes in the external carbon source by using a microfluidic platform that allows precise, dynamic control over environmental conditions. We show that the metabolic system acts as a low-pass filter that reliably responds to a slowly changing environment, while effectively ignoring fast fluctuations. The sensitive low-frequency response was significantly faster than in predictions arising from our computational modelling, and this discrepancy was resolved by the discovery that two key galactose transcripts possess half-lives that depend on the carbon source. Finally, to explore how induction characteristics affect frequency response, we compare two S. cerevisiae strains and show that they have the same frequency response despite having markedly different induction properties. This suggests that although certain characteristics of the complex networks may differ when probed in a static environment, the system has been optimized for a robust response to a dynamically changing environment.},

Additionally, inactivation of the X during spermatogenesis can make the X chromosome an unfavorable location for male-specific genes. These factors can help to explain why in many species gene content of the X chromosome differs from that of autosomes. Indeed, the X chromosome in mouse is enriched for male-specific genes while they are depleted on the X in Drosophila but show neither of these trends in mosquito. Here, we will discuss recent findings on the ancestral and neo-X chromosomes in Drosophila that support sexual antagonism as a force shaping gene content evolution of sex chromosomes and suggest that selection could be driving male-biased genes off the X.},

@article{Ruhe2014,
abstract = {Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is a mode of bacterial competition orchestrated by the CdiB/CdiA family of two-partner secretion proteins. The CdiA effector extends from the surface of CDI(+) inhibitor cells, binds to receptors on neighboring bacteria and delivers a toxin domain derived from its C-terminal region (CdiA-CT). Here, we show that CdiA-CT toxin translocation requires the proton-motive force (pmf) within target bacteria. The pmf is also critical for the translocation of colicin toxins, which exploit the energized Ton and Tol systems to cross the outer membrane. However, CdiA-CT translocation is clearly distinct from known colicin-import pathways because $\Delta$tolA $\Delta$tonB target cells are fully sensitive to CDI. Moreover, we provide evidence that CdiA-CT toxins can be transferred into the periplasm of de-energized target bacteria, indicating that transport across the outer membrane is independent of the pmf. Remarkably, CDI toxins transferred under de-energized conditions remain competent to enter the target-cell cytoplasm once the pmf is restored. Collectively, these results indicate that outer- and inner-membrane translocation steps can be uncoupled, and that the pmf is required for CDI toxin transport from the periplasm to the target-cell cytoplasm.},

abstract = {A general method is described for constructing simple dynamical models to approximate complex dynamical systems with many$\backslash$n                     degrees of freedom. The technique can be applied to interpret sets of observed time series or numerical simulations with high-resolution$\backslash$n                     models, or to relate observation and simulations. The method is based on a projection of the complete system on to a smaller$\backslash$n                     number of âprincipal interaction patternsâ (PIPs). The coefficients of the PIP expansion are assumed to be governed by a dynamic$\backslash$n                     model containing a small number of adjustable parameters. The optimization of the dynamical model, which in the general case$\backslash$n                     can be both nonlinear and time-dependent, is carried out simultaneously with the construction of the optimal set of interaction$\backslash$n                     patterns.

abstract = {Avian pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) strains frequently cause extraintestinal infections and are responsible for significant economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. APEC isolates are closely related to human extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) strains and may also act as pathogens for humans. Known APEC virulence factors include adhesins such as type 1 fimbriae and curli, iron acquisition systems, and cytotoxins. Here we show that APEC strain SEPT362, isolated from a septicemic hen, expresses a type VI secretion system (T6SS); causes cytoskeleton rearrangements; and invades epithelial cells, replicates within macrophages, and causes lethal disease in chicks. To assess the contribution of the T6SS to SEPT362 pathogenesis, we generated two mutants, hcp (which encodes a protein suggested to be both secreted and a structural component of the T6SS) and clpV (encoding the T6SS ATPase). Both mutants showed decreased adherence and actin rearrangement on epithelial cells. However, only the hcp mutant presented a mild decrease in its ability to invade epithelial cells, and none of these mutants were defective for intramacrophage replication. Transcriptome studies showed that the level of expression of type 1 fimbriae was decreased in these mutants, which may account for the diminished adhesion and invasion of epithelial cells. The T6SS seems to be important for the disease process, given that both mutants were attenuated for infection in chicks. These results suggest that the T6SS influences the expression of type 1 fimbriae and contributes to APEC pathogenesis.},

abstract = {Dynamic, multicompartment in vitro gastrointestinal simulators are often used to monitor gut microbial dynamics and activity. These reactors need to harbor a microbial community that is stable upon inoculation, colon region specific, and relevant to in vivo conditions. Together with the reproducibility of the colonization process, these criteria are often overlooked when the modulatory properties from different treatments are compared. We therefore investigated the microbial colonization process in two identical simulators of the human intestinal microbial ecosystem (SHIME), simultaneously inoculated with the same human fecal microbiota with a high-resolution phylogenetic microarray: the human intestinal tract chip (HITChip). Following inoculation of the in vitro colon compartments, microbial community composition reached steady state after 2 weeks, whereas 3 weeks were required to reach functional stability. This dynamic colonization process was reproducible in both SHIME units and resulted in highly diverse microbial communities which were colon region specific, with the proximal regions harboring saccharolytic microbes (e.g., Bacteroides spp. and Eubacterium spp.) and the distal regions harboring mucin-degrading microbes (e.g., Akkermansia spp.). Importantly, the shift from an in vivo to an in vitro environment resulted in an increased Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio, whereas Clostridium cluster IX (propionate producers) was enriched compared to clusters IV and XIVa (butyrate producers). This was supported by proportionally higher in vitro propionate concentrations. In conclusion, high-resolution analysis of in vitro-cultured gut microbiota offers new insight on the microbial colonization process and indicates the importance of digestive parameters that may be crucial in the development of new in vitro models.},

abstract = {Photobleaching of the fluorophore fluorescein in an aqueous solution is dependent on the oxygen concentration. Therefore, the time-dependent bleaching behavior can be used to measure of dissolved oxygen concentrations. The method can be combined with epi-fluorescence microscopy. The molecular states of the fluorophore can be expressed by a three-state energy model. This leads to a set of differential equations which describe the photobleaching behavior of fluorescein. The numerical solution of these equations shows that in a conventional wide-field fluorescence microscope, the fluorescence of fluorescein will fade out faster at low than at high oxygen concentration. Further simulation showed that a simple ratio function of different time-points during a fluorescence decay recorded during photobleaching could be used to describe oxygen concentrations in an aqueous solution. By careful choice of dye concentration and excitation light intensity the sensitivity in the oxygen concentration range of interest can be optimized. In the simulations, the estimation of oxygen concentration by the ratio function was very little affected by the pH value in the range of pH 6.5-8.5. Filming the fluorescence decay by a charge-coupled-device (ccd) camera mounted on a fluorescence microscope allowed a pixelwise estimation of the ratio function in a microscopic image. Use of a microsensor and oxygen-consuming bacteria in a sample chamber enabled the calibration of the system for quantification of absolute oxygen concentrations. The method was demonstrated on nitrifying biofilms growing on snail and mussel shells, showing clear effects of metabolic activity on oxygen concentrations. Microsc. Res.

abstract = {Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins are chromosomal ATPases, highly conserved from bacteria to humans, that play fundamental roles in many aspects of higher-order chromosome organization and dynamics. In eukaryotes, SMC1 and SMC3 act as the core of the cohesin complexes that mediate sister chromatid cohesion, whereas SMC2 and SMC4 function as the core of the condensin complexes that are essential for chromosome assembly and segregation. Another complex containing SMC5 and SMC6 is implicated in DNA repair and checkpoint responses. The SMC complexes form unique ring- or V-shaped structures with long coiled-coil arms, and function as ATP-modulated, dynamic molecular linkers of the genome. Recent studies shed new light on the mechanistic action of these SMC machines and also expanded the repertoire of their diverse cellular functions. Dissecting this class of chromosomal ATPases is likely to be central to our understanding of the structural basis of genome organization, stability, and evolution.},

Induction of the cell division inhibitor SulA, a component of the SOS response, or the inhibitor MinCD, a component of the min system, blocked formation of the FtsZ ring and led to filamentation. Reversal of SulA inhibition by blocking protein synthesis in SulA-induced filaments led to a resumption of FtsZ ring formation and division. These results suggested that these inhibitors block cell division by preventing FtsZ localization into the ring structure. In addition, analysis of min mutants demonstrated that FtsZ ring formation was also associated with minicell formation, indicating that all septation events in E. coli involve the FtsZ ring.},

The slowly growing bacteria are tolerant of antibiotics and other environmental insults, whereas their isogenic, rapidly growing siblings are sensitive. Recent research has shown that persistence of the model organism Escherichia coli depends on toxin-antitoxin (TA) loci. Deletion of type II TA loci reduces the level of persistence significantly. Lon protease but no other known ATP-dependent proteases is required for persistence. Polyphosphate and (p)ppGpp also are required for persistence. These observations led to the proposal of a simple and testable model that explains the persistence of E. coli. It is now important to challenge this model and to test whether the persistence of pathogenic bacteria also depends on TA loci.},

abstract = {The metabolic regulation of Escherichia coli lacking a functional pykF gene was investigated based on gene expressions, enzyme activities, intracellular metabolite concentrations and the metabolic flux distribution obtained based on (13)C-labeling experiments. RT-PCR revealed that the glycolytic genes such as glk, pgi, pfkA and tpiA were down regulated, that ppc, pckA, maeB and mdh genes were strongly up-regulated, and that the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway genes such as zwf and gnd were significantly up-regulated in the pykF mutant. The catabolite repressor/activator gene fruR was up-regulated in the pykF mutant, but the adenylate cyclase gene cyaA was down-regulated indicating a decreased rate of glucose uptake. This was also ascertained by the degradation of ptsG mRNA, the gene for which was down-regulated in the pykF mutant. In general, the changes in enzyme activities more or less correlated with ratios of gene expression, while the changes in metabolic fluxes did not correlate with enzyme activities. For example, high flux ratios were obtained through the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway due to an increased concentration of glucose-6-phosphate rather than to favorable enzyme activity ratios. In contrast, due to decreased availability of pyruvate (and acetyl coenzyme A) in the pykF mutant compared with the wild type, low flux ratios were found through lactate and acetate forming pathways.},

abstract = {Dosage compensation is an essential process that equalizes X-linked gene dosage between the sexes. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, a complex of proteins called the dosage compensation complex (DCC) binds both X chromosomes in hermaphrodites to downregulate gene expression two-fold and hence to reduce X-linked gene expression levels equal to that in males. Five subunits of the DCC form the condensin I(DC) complex, a homolog of the evolutionarily conserved condensin complex required for chromosome segregation and compaction during mitosis and meiosis. How related complexes can perform such diverse functions remains a mystery. Nevertheless, it is believed that the mitotic and interphase functions of condensin are mechanistically related and understanding one process will reveal new insights into the other. We discuss how during worm dosage compensation a condensin-mediated function may guide the organization of the interphase chromatin fibers, leading to the formation of a repressive nuclear compartment.},

Here, we used two orthogonal fluorescence labeling tools to report the amounts of mRNA and protein produced in a reconstituted biosynthesis system, simultaneously and in real-time. The Spinach RNA aptamer and its fluorogenic probe were used for mRNA detection. Applying this dual-reporter assay to the analysis of transcript and protein production inside lipid vesicles revealed that their levels are uncorrelated, most probably a consequence of the low copy-number of some components in liposome-confined reactions. We believe that the stochastic nature of gene expression should be appreciated as a design principle for the assembly of a minimal cell.},

abstract = {The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) of Escherichia coli is a dimer made up of identical subunits. Each CRP subunit contains a cyclic nucleotide binding pocket and the CRP dimer exhibits negative cooperativity in binding cAMP. In solutions containing cAMP, CRP undergoes sequential conformation changes from the inactive apo-form through the active CRP:(cAMP) 1 complex to the less active CRP:(cAMP) 2 complex depending on the cAMP concentration. Apo-CRP binds DNA with low affinity and no apparent sequence specificity. The CRP:(cAMP) 1 complex exhibits high affinity, sequence-specific DNA binding and interacts with RNA polymerase, whether free in solution or complexed with DNA. The results of genetic, biochemical and biophysical studies have helped to uncover many of the details of cAMP-mediated allosteric control over CRP conformation and activity as a transcription factor. These studies indicate that cAMP binding produces only small, but significant, changes in CRP structure; changes that include subunit realignment and concerted motion of the secondary structure elements within the C-terminal DNA binding domain of each subunit. These adjustments promote CRP surface-patch interaction with RNA polymerase and protrusion of the F-helix to promote CRP site-specific interaction with DNA. Interactions between CRP and RNA polymerase at CRP-dependent promoters produce active ternary transcription complexes. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Precise temporal and spatial control of cell division is essential for progeny survival. The current general view is that precise positioning of the division site at midcell in rod-shaped bacteria is a result of the combined action of the Min system and nucleoid (chromosome) occlusion. Both systems prevent assembly of the cytokinetic Z ring at inappropriate places in the cell, restricting Z rings to the correct site at midcell. Here we show that in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis Z rings are positioned precisely at midcell in the complete absence of both these systems, revealing the existence of a mechanism independent of Min and nucleoid occlusion that identifies midcell in this organism. We further show that Z ring assembly at midcell is delayed in the absence of Min and Noc proteins, while at the same time FtsZ accumulates at other potential division sites. This suggests that a major role for Min and Noc is to ensure efficient utilization of the midcell division site by preventing Z ring assembly at potential division sites, including the cell poles. Our data lead us to propose a model in which spatial regulation of division in B. subtilis involves identification of the division site at midcell that requires Min and nucleoid occlusion to ensure efficient Z ring assembly there and only there, at the right time in the cell cycle.},

By observing groups of cells for hundreds of generations at single-cell resolution, we reveal that growth noise causes clonal populations of Escherichia coli to double faster than the mean doubling time of their constituent single cells across a broad set of balanced-growth conditions. We show that the population-level growth rate gain as well as age structures of populations and of cell lineages in competition are predictable. Furthermore, we theoretically reveal that the growth rate gain can be linked with the relative entropy of lineage generation time distributions. Unexpectedly, we find an empirical linear relation between the means and the variances of generation times across conditions, which provides a general constraint on maximal growth rates. Together, these results demonstrate a fundamental benefit of noise for population growth, and identify a growth law that sets a âspeed limitâ for proliferation.},

Controlling the expression of the genes encoding luciferase, the low abundance E.coli protein DnaJ and restriction endonuclease Cfr9I not only demonstrates that high levels of expression can be achieved but also suggests that under conditions of optimal repression only around one mRNA every 3rd generation is produced. This potential of quantitative control will open up new approaches in the study of gene function in vivo, in particular with low abundance regulatory gene products.

abstract = {Stochasticity is both exploited and controlled by cells. Although the intrinsic stochasticity inherent in biochemistry is relatively well understood, cellular variation, or 'noise', is predominantly generated by interactions of the system of interest with other stochastic systems in the cell or its environment. Such extrinsic fluctuations are nonspecific, affecting many system components, and have a substantial lifetime, comparable to the cell cycle (they are 'colored'). Here, we extend the standard stochastic simulation algorithm to include extrinsic fluctuations. We show that these fluctuations affect mean protein numbers and intrinsic noise, can speed up typical network response times, and can explain trends in high-throughput measurements of variation. If extrinsic fluctuations in two components of the network are correlated, they may combine constructively (amplifying each other) or destructively (attenuating each other). Consequently, we predict that incoherent feedforward loops attenuate stochasticity, while coherent feedforwards amplify it. Our results demonstrate that both the timescales of extrinsic fluctuations and their nonspecificity substantially affect the function and performance of biochemical networks.},

@article{Panda2015,
abstract = {The increase in antibiotic resistance has become a major health concern in recent times. It is therefore essential to identify novel antibacterial targets as well as discover and develop new antibacterial agents. FtsZ, a highly conserved bacterial protein, is responsible for the initiation of cell division in bacteria. The functions of FtsZ inside cells are tightly regulated and any perturbation in its functions leads to inhibition of bacterial division. Recent reports indicate that small molecules targeting the functions of FtsZ may be used as leads to develop new antibacterial agents. To identify small molecules targeting FtsZ and inhibiting bacterial division, we screened a U.S. FDA (Food and Drug Administration)-approved drug library of 800 molecules using an independent computational, biochemical and microbial approach. From this screen, we identified doxorubicin, an anthracycline molecule that inhibits Escherichia coli division and forms filamentous cells. A fluorescence-binding assay shows that doxorubicin interacts strongly with FtsZ. A detailed biochemical analysis demonstrated that doxorubicin inhibits FtsZ assembly and its GTPase activity through binding to a site other than the GTP-binding site. Furthermore, using molecular docking, we identified a probable doxorubicin-binding site in FtsZ. A number of single amino acid mutations at the identified binding site in FtsZ resulted in a severalfold decrease in the affinity of FtsZ for doxorubicin, indicating the importance of this site for doxorubicin interaction. The present study suggests the presence of a novel binding site in FtsZ that interacts with the small molecules and can be targeted for the screening and development of new antibacterial agents.},

The model-based predictions and associated experiments help explain why only one of two classes of activating Ras point mutations with in vitro transformation potential is commonly found in cancers. Model-based analysis of these mutants uncovered a systems-level process that contributes to total Ras activation in cells. This predicted behavior was supported by experimental observations. We also used the model to identify a strategy in which a drug could cause stronger inhibition on the cancerous Ras network than on the wild-type network. This system-level analysis of the oncogenic Ras network provides new insights and potential therapeutic strategies.},

abstract = {The EnvZ/OmpR system in Escherichia coli, which regulates the expression of the porins OmpF and OmpC, is one of the simplest and best-characterized examples of two-component signaling. Like many other histidine kinases, EnvZ is bifunctional; it phosphorylates and dephosphorylates the response regulator OmpR. We have analyzed a mathematical model of the EnvZ-mediated cycle of OmpR phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The model predicts that when EnvZ is much less abundant than OmpR, as is the case in E. coli, the steady-state level of phosphorylated OmpR (OmpR-P) is insensitive to variations in the concentration of EnvZ. The model also predicts that the level of OmpR-P is insensitive to variations in the concentration of OmpR when the OmpR concentration is sufficiently high. To test these predictions, we have perturbed the porin regulatory circuit in E. coli by varying the expression levels of EnvZ and OmpR. We have constructed two-color fluorescent reporter strains in which ompF and ompC transcription can be easily measured in the same culture. Using these strains we have shown that, consistent with the predictions of our model, the transcription of ompC and ompF is indeed robust or insensitive to a wide range of expression levels of both EnvZ and OmpR.},

abstract = {The multisubunit condensin complex is essential for the structural organization of eukaryotic chromosomes during their segregation by the mitotic spindle, but the mechanistic basis for its function is not understood. To address how condensin binds to and structures chromosomes, we have isolated from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells circular minichromosomes linked to condensin. We find that either linearization of minichromosome DNA or proteolytic opening of the ring-like structure formed through the connection of the two ATPase heads of condensin's structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) heterodimer by its kleisin subunit eliminates their association. This suggests that condensin rings encircle chromosomal DNA. We further show that release of condensin from chromosomes by ring opening in dividing cells compromises the partitioning of chromosome regions distal to centromeres. Condensin hence forms topological links within chromatid arms that provide the arms with the structural rigidity necessary for their segregation.},

abstract = {Chromosomal stability is safeguarded by a mitotic checkpoint, of which BUB1 and Mad3/BUBR1 are core components. These paralogs have similar, but not identical, domain organization. We show that Mad3/BUBR1 and BUB1 paralogous pairs arose by nine independent gene duplications throughout evolution, followed by parallel subfunctionalization in which preservation of the ancestral, amino-terminal KEN box or kinase domain was mutually exclusive. In one exception, vertebrate BUBR1-defined by the KEN box-preserved the kinase domain but allowed nonconserved degeneration of catalytic motifs. Although BUBR1 evolved to a typical pseudokinase in some vertebrates, it retained the catalytic triad in humans. However, we show that putative catalysis by human BUBR1 is dispensable for error-free chromosome segregation. Instead, residues that interact with ATP in conventional kinases are essential for conformational stability in BUBR1. We propose that parallel evolution of BUBR1 orthologs rendered its kinase function dispensable in vertebrates, producing an unusual, triad-containing pseudokinase.},

Through a biochemical implementation of Bayes's rule, we show that genetic networks can act as inference modules, inferring from intracellular conditions the likely state of the extracellular environment and regulating gene expression appropriately. By considering a two-state environment, either poor or rich in nutrients, we show that promoter occupancy is proportional to the (posterior) probability of the high nutrient state given current intracellular information. We demonstrate that single-gene networks inferring and responding to a high environmental state infer best when negatively controlled, and those inferring and responding to a low environmental state infer best when positively controlled. Our interpretation is supported by experimental data from the lac operon and should provide a basis for both understanding more complex cellular decision-making and designing synthetic inference circuits.},

Here we explore a model for coupling two stochastic processes where the noise of the combined process can be smaller than that of the isolated ones. Such a canalization occurs if, and only if, there is negative covariance between the random variables of the model. Our results are obtained in the framework of a master equation for a negatively self-regulated -- or externally regulated -- binary gene and show that the precise control due to negative self regulation $\backslash$cite{\{}becskei00{\}} is because it may generate negative covariance.

This study delves more deeply into the mechanism by which XSEs transmit X chromosome dose. We determined the relative contributions of individual XSEs to the X:A signal and showed the order of XSE strength to be sex-1 {\textgreater} sex-2 {\textgreater} fox-1 {\textgreater} ceh-39 {\textgreater}/= region 1 XSE. sex-1 exerts a more potent influence on sex determination and dosage compensation than any other XSE by functioning in two separate capacities in the pathway: sex-1 acts upstream as an XSE to repress xol-1 and downstream as an activator of hermaphrodite development and dosage compensation. Furthermore, the process of dosage compensation affects expression of the very XSEs that control it; XSEs become fully dosage compensated once sex is determined. The X:A signal is then equivalent between XO and XX animals, causing sexual differentiation to be controlled by genes downstream of xol-1 in the sex-determination pathway. Prior to the onset of dosage compensation, the difference in XSE expression between XX and XO embryos appears to be greater than twofold, making X chromosome counting a robust process.},

Different patterns of chromatin composition and histone modification were revealed between chromosome arms and centers, with similarly prominent differences between autosomes and the X chromosome.

These relations are often unknown and may depend on the state of bacterial growth. To bridge this gap, we have investigated Escherichia coli strains expressing resistance to translation-inhibiting antibiotics. We show that resistance expression and drug inhibition are linked in a positive feedback loop arising from an innate, global effect of drug-inhibited growth on gene expression. A quantitative model of bacterial growth based on this innate feedback accurately predicts the rich phenomena observed: a plateau-shaped fitness landscape, with an abrupt drop in the growth rates of cultures at a threshold drug concentration, and the coexistence of growing and nongrowing populations, that is, growth bistability, below the threshold.},

abstract = {Triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), which catalyses the conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), was studied for its control on glycolysis and mixed acid production in L. lactis subspecies lactis IL1403 and L. lactis subspecies cremoris MG1363. Strains in which the TPI activity was modulated from 3{\%}-225{\%} (IL1403) or 13{\%}-103{\%} (MG1363) of the wild-type level were constructed by changing the expression of the tpiA gene. The enzyme was found to be present in high excess in the wild-type cells and 10{\%} TPI activity still supported more than 70{\%} of the wild-type glycolytic flux in both strains. Homolactic product formation was preserved throughout the range of TPI activities studied, although a slight increase in the amount of acetate and formate production was observed in the strains with strongly reduced TPI activity for both IL1403 and MG1363. The upstream metabolites glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate and DHAP in the IL1403 derivatives were essentially unchanged for TPI activities from 26{\%} to 225{\%}. At a TPI activity of 3{\%}, the level of DHAP increased four times. The finding that an increased level of DHAP coincides with an increase in formate production is surprising and indicates that pyruvate formate lyase is not inhibited by DHAP under these conditions.},

abstract = {The published C-terminal sequence of Escherichia coli 50S ribosomal protein L31, ellipsisRFNK (Brosius, J. (1978) Biochemistry 17, 501-508), differs from that predicted by the gene sequence, ellipsisRFNKRFNIPGSK (GenBank accession no. X78541). This discrepancy might be due to post-translational processing of the protein. To examine this possibility, we have isolated L31 from E. coli strain MRE600 and sequenced the C-terminal tryptic peptide. We find the sequence to be FBIPGSK. Size comparisons of L31 from several E. coli strains demonstrate that all are identical in size to the protein isolated from MRE600 and larger than the previously described protein, indicating that ellipsisRFNKRFNIPGSK represents the true C-terminus of L31. In addition, we show that the failure to identify L31 in many ribosome preparations is probably due to the protein's loose association with the ribosome and its ability to form various intramolecular disulfide bonds, leading to L31 forms with distinct mobilities in gels.},

abstract = {Intestinal crypts in mammals are comprised of long-lived stem cells and shorter-lived progenies. These two populations are maintained in specific proportions during adult life. Here, we investigate the design principles governing the dynamics of these proportions during crypt morphogenesis. Using optimal control theory, we show that a proliferation strategy known as a "bang-bang" control minimizes the time to obtain a mature crypt. This strategy consists of a surge of symmetric stem cell divisions, establishing the entire stem cell pool first, followed by a sharp transition to strictly asymmetric stem cell divisions, producing nonstem cells with a delay. We validate these predictions using lineage tracing and single-molecule fluorescence inÂ situ hybridization of intestinal crypts in infant mice, uncovering small crypts that are entirely composed of Lgr5-labeled stem cells, which become a minority as crypts continue to grow. Our approach can be used to uncover similar design principles in other developmental systems.},

While initially regarded as a key driver of mitotic chromosome condensation, condensin is increasingly viewed as having a more subtle influence on chromosome architecture. The two condensin complexes are required to direct the correct folding and organization of chromosomes prior to anaphase and for keeping the chromosomes compact as they separate to the poles. This ancient complex is essential in mitosis and meiosis and has additional roles in gene regulation and DNA repair. The wide variety of biochemical and genetic tools available are gradually unravelling the numerous roles condensin plays during the cell cycle and shedding light on its mechanism of action.},

abstract = {Gene expression and binary interaction techniques are vital tools that shape our understanding of protein complexes. An inherent flaw, however, with most current protein-protein interaction techniques is the variability in expression levels for fusion proteins when using several individual plasmids. Here, we describe a novel recombination-based cloning strategy called 2in1 that enables co-expression of fusion proteins on a cell-by-cell basis from a single plasmid. We demonstrate the utility of 2in1 through the development of a ratiometric bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (rBiFC), in which both candidate genes are simultaneously cloned into a single vector backbone containing an internal fluorescent marker for expression control and ratiometric analysis. rBiFC significantly increases the credibility of protein-protein interaction results allowing ratiometric comparison between different protein pairs. In addition to its use in rBiFC, 2in1 can be introduced easily into other vector systems that rely on multiple gene expression and prove feasible in future synthetic biological approaches.},

abstract = {The Escherichia coli phosphate (PHO) regulon includes 31 (or more) genes arranged in eight separate operons. All are coregulated by environmental (extra-cellular) phosphate and are probably involved in phosphorus assimilation. Pi control of these genes requires the sensor PhoR, the response regulator PhoB, the binding protein-dependent Pi-specific transporter Pst, and the accessory protein PhoU. During Pi limitation, PhoR turns on genes of the PHO regulon by phosphorylating PhoB that in turn activates transcription by binding to promoters that share an 18-base consensus PHO Box. When Pi is in excess, PhoR, Pst, and PhoU together turn off the PHO regulon, presumably by dephosphorylating PhoB. In addition, two Pi-independent controls that may be forms of cross regulation turn on the PHO regulon in the absence of PhoR. The sensor CreC, formerly called PhoM, phosphorylates PhoB in response to some (unknown) catabolite, while acetyl phosphate may directly phosphorylate PhoB. Cross regulation of the PHO regulon by CreC and acetyl phosphate may be examples of underlying control mechanisms important for the general (global) control of cell growth and metabolism.},

abstract = {The earliest stage in bacterial cell division is the formation of a ring, composed of the tubulin-like protein FtsZ, at the division site. Tight spatial and temporal regulation of Z-ring formation is required to ensure that division occurs precisely at midcell between two replicated chromosomes. However, the mechanism of Z-ring formation and its regulation in vivo remain unresolved. Here we identify the defect of an interesting temperature-sensitive ftsZ mutant (ts1) of Bacillus subtilis. At the nonpermissive temperature, the mutant protein, FtsZ(Ts1), assembles into spiral-like structures between chromosomes. When shifted back down to the permissive temperature, functional Z rings form and division resumes. Our observations support a model in which Z-ring formation at the division site arises from reorganization of a long cytoskeletal spiral form of FtsZ and suggest that the FtsZ(Ts1) protein is captured as a shorter spiral-forming intermediate that is unable to complete this reorganization step. The ts1 mutant is likely to be very valuable in revealing how FtsZ assembles into a ring and how this occurs precisely at the division site.},

abstract = {Cellular identity during metazoan development is maintained by epigenetic modifications of chromatin structure brought about by the activity of specific proteins which mediate histone variant incorporation, histone modifications, and nucleosome remodeling. HP1 proteins directly influence gene expression by modifying chromatin structure. We previously showed that the Caenorhabditis elegans HP1 proteins HPL-1 and HPL-2 are required for several aspects of post-embryonic development. To gain insight into how HPL proteins influence gene expression in a developmental context, we carried out a candidate RNAi screen to identify suppressors of hpl-1 and hpl-2 phenotypes. We identified SET-2, the homologue of yeast and mammalian SET1, as an antagonist of HPL-1 and HPL-2 activity in growth and somatic gonad development. Yeast Set1 and its mammalian counterparts SET1/MLL are H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) histone methyltransferases associated with gene activation as part of large multisubunit complexes. We show that the nematode counterparts of SET1/MLL complex subunits also antagonize HPL function in post-embryonic development. Genetic analysis is consistent with SET1/MLL complex subunits having both shared and unique functions in development. Furthermore, as observed in other species, we find that SET1/MLL complex homologues differentially affect global H3K4 methylation. Our results suggest that HP1 and a SET1/MLL-related complex may play antagonistic roles in the epigenetic regulation of specific developmental programs.},

abstract = {Stochastic variation in cell cycle time is a consistent feature of otherwise similar cells within a growing population. Classic studies concluded that the bulk of the variation occurs in the G1 phase, and many mathematical models assume a constant time for traversing the S/G2/M phases. By direct observation of transgenic fluorescent fusion proteins that report the onset of S phase, we establish that dividing B and T lymphocytes spend a near-fixed proportion of total division time in S/G2/M phases, and this proportion is correlated between sibling cells. This result is inconsistent with models that assume independent times for consecutive phases. Instead, we propose a stretching model for dividing lymphocytes where all parts of the cell cycle are proportional to total division time. Data fitting based on a stretched cell cycle model can significantly improve estimates of cell cycle parameters drawn from DNA labeling data used to monitor immune cell dynamics.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory interactions are context dependent, active in some cellular states but not in others. Stochastic fluctuations, or 'noise', in gene expression propagate through active, but not inactive, regulatory links. Thus, correlations in gene expression noise could provide a noninvasive means to probe the activity states of regulatory links. However, global, 'extrinsic', noise sources generate correlations even without direct regulatory links. Here we show that single-cell time-lapse microscopy, by revealing time lags due to regulation, can discriminate between active regulatory connections and extrinsic noise. We demonstrate this principle mathematically, using stochastic modeling, and experimentally, using simple synthetic gene circuits. We then use this approach to analyze dynamic noise correlations in the galactose metabolism genes of Escherichia coli. We find that the CRPGalS-GalE feed-forward loop is inactive in standard conditions but can become active in a GalR mutant. These results show how noise can help analyze the context dependence of regulatory interactions in endogenous gene circuits.},

abstract = {We investigate cellular response to extracellular signals by using information theory techniques motivated by recent experiments. We present results for the steady state of the following gene regulatory models found in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells: a linear transcription-translation model and a positive or negative auto-regulatory model. We calculate both the information capacity and the mutual information exactly for simple models and approximately for the full model. We find that (1) small changes in mutual information can lead to potentially important changes in cellular response and (2) there are diminishing returns in the fidelity of response as the mutual information increases. We calculate the information capacity using Gillespie simulations of a model for the TNF-$\alpha$-NF-$\kappa$ B network and find good agreement with the measured value for an experimental realization of this network. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of the differences in cellular response when comparing experimentally measured mutual information values of different gene regulatory models. Our calculations demonstrate that Gillespie simulations can be used to compute the mutual information of more complex gene regulatory models, providing a potentially useful tool in synthetic biology.},

abstract = {Cell division in typical rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli shows a remarkable plasticity in being able to adapt to a variety of irregular cell shapes. Here, we investigate the roles of the Min system and the nucleoid-occlusion factor SlmA in supporting this adaptation. We study "squeezed" E. coli in narrow nanofabricated channels where these bacteria exhibit highly irregular shapes and large volumes. Despite the severely anomalous morphologies we find that most of these bacteria maintain their ability to divide into two equally sized daughters with an accuracy comparable to that of normal rod-shaped cells (about 4{\%}). Deletion of either slmA or minC shows that the molecular systems associated with these genes are largely dispensable for accurate cell division in these irregular cell shapes. Using fluorescence time-lapse microscopy, we determine that the functionality of the Min system is affected by the cell shape, whereas the localization of a nucleoid relative to the cell division proteins (the divisome) remains unperturbed in a broad spectrum of morphologies, consistent with nucleoid occlusion. The observed positioning of the nucleoid relative to the divisome appears not to be affected by the nucleoid-occlusion factor SlmA. The current study underscores the importance of nucleoid occlusion in positioning the divisome and shows that it is robust against shape irregularities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To connect gene expression with cellular physiology, we need to follow levels of proteins over time. Experiments typically use variants of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), and time-series measurements require specialist expertise if single cells are to be followed. Fluorescence plate readers, however, a standard in many laboratories, can in principle provide similar data, albeit at a mean, population level. Nevertheless, extracting the average fluorescence per cell is challenging because autofluorescence can be substantial.

RESULTS: Here we propose a general method for correcting plate reader measurements of fluorescent proteins that uses spectral unmixing and determines both the fluorescence per cell and the errors on that fluorescence. Combined with strain collections, such as the GFP fusion collection for budding yeast, our methodology allows quantitative measurements of protein levels of up to hundreds of genes and therefore provides complementary data to high throughput studies of transcription. We illustrate the method by following the induction of the GAL genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for over 20 hours in different sugars and argue that the order of appearance of the Leloir enzymes may be to reduce build-up of the toxic intermediate galactose-1-phosphate. Further, we quantify protein levels of over 40 genes, again over 20 hours, after cells experience a change in carbon source (from glycerol to glucose).

CONCLUSIONS: Our methodology is sensitive, scalable, and should be applicable to other organisms. By allowing quantitative measurements on a per cell basis over tens of hours and over hundreds of genes, it should increase our understanding of the dynamic changes that drive cellular behaviour.},

This technique employs a special class of coarse-grained models that are gaining popularity because they allow simulations of large scale systems and, at the same time, they provide sufficiently detailed chemistry for the mapping scheme adopted. The comparison of the computational costs of our approach with standard molecular dynamics simulations is a function of the system size and the number of processors employed in the parallel calculations. Due to the low amount of data exchange, the larger the number of processors, the better are the performances of the hybrid particle-field models. This feature makes these models very promising ones in the exploration of several problems in biophysics.},

Many of the outbreaks have been large (involving {\textgreater}150 cases), necessitating rapid responses from the international community to help implement infection control and surveillance. This increased activity, combined with today's climate of bioterrorism threats, has heightened the need for high-throughput methodologies for specific detection of these high-hazard viruses in sophisticated laboratory setups and mobile field laboratory situations. Using Zaire Ebola virus as an example, we describe here the development of a high-throughput protocol for RNA extraction and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis that is safe, fast, and reliable. Furthermore, the applicability of this method to an outbreak setting was demonstrated by correct analysis of {\textgreater}500 specimens at a field laboratory established during a recent outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever in Angola.},

This type of mechanism sets the level of gene expression and, as a consequence, the phenotypic characteristics. Because many types of regulatory processes exhibit dosage-dependent behavior, they would impact quantitative traits and contribute to their multigenic control in a semidominant fashion. Many dosage-dependent effects would also account for the extensive modulation of gene expression throughout the genome that occurs when chromosomes are added to or subtracted from the karyotype (aneuploidy). Moreover, because the majority of dosage-dependent regulators act negatively, this property can account for the up-regulation of genes in monosomics and hemizygous sex chromosomes to achieve dosage compensation.},

abstract = {The ribosome's interactions with mRNA govern its translation rate and the effects of post-transcriptional regulation. Long, structured 5' untranslated regions (5' UTRs) are commonly found in bacterial mRNAs, though the physical mechanisms that determine how the ribosome binds these upstream regions remain poorly defined. Here, we systematically investigate the ribosome's interactions with structured standby sites, upstream of Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and show that these interactions can modulate translation initiation rates by over 100-fold. We find that an mRNA's translation initiation rate is controlled by the amount of single-stranded surface area, the partial unfolding of RNA structures to minimize the ribosome's binding free energy penalty, the absence of cooperative binding and the potential for ribosomal sliding. We develop a biophysical model employing thermodynamic first principles and a four-parameter free energy model to accurately predict the ribosome's translation initiation rates for 136 synthetic 5' UTRs with large structures, diverse shapes and multiple standby site modules. The model predicts and experiments confirm that the ribosome can readily bind distant standby site modules that support high translation rates, providing a physical mechanism for observed context effects and long-range post-transcriptional regulation.},

How is balanced utilization achieved, despite fluctuations in the concentrations of the enzymes that make up the regulatory circuitry? Here we address this question by studying the nitrogen system of E. coli. A mechanism based on the avidity of a bifunctional enzyme, adenylyltransferase (AT/AR), to its multimeric substrate, glutamine synthetase, is proposed to maintain a robust ratio between two key metabolites, glutamine and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. This ratio is predicted to be insensitive to variations in protein levels of the core circuit and to the rate of nitrogen utilization. We find using mass spectrometry that the metabolite ratio is robust to variations in protein levels and that this robustness depends on the bifunctional enzyme. Moreover, robustness carries through to the bacteria growth rate. Interrupting avidity by adding a monofunctional AT/AR mutant to the native system abolishes robustness, as predicted by the proposed mechanism.},

abstract = {Background: Current methods for analyzing the dynamics of natural regulatory networks, and quantifying synthetic circuit function, are limited by the lack of well-characterized genetic measurement tools. Fluorescent reporters have been used to measure dynamic gene expression, but recent attempts to monitor multiple genes simultaneously in single cells have not focused on independent, isolated measurements. Multiple reporters can be used to observe interactions between natural genes, or to facilitate the 'debugging' of biologically engineered genetic networks. Using three distinguishable reporter genes in a single cell can reveal information not obtainable from only one or two reporters. One application of multiple reporters is the use of genetic noise to reveal regulatory connections between genes. Experiments in both natural and synthetic systems would benefit from a well-characterized platform for expressing multiple reporter genes and synthetic network components. Results: We describe such a plasmid-based platform for the design and optimization of synthetic gene networks, and for analysis of endogenous gene networks. This network scaffold consists of three distinguishable fluorescent reporter genes controlled by inducible promoters, with conveniently placed restriction sites to make modifications straightforward. We quantitatively characterize the scaffold in Escherichia coli with single-cell fluorescence imaging and time-lapse microscopy. The three spectrally distinct reporters allow independent monitoring of genetic regulation and analysis of genetic noise. As a novel application of this tool we show that the presence of genetic noise can reveal transcriptional co-regulation due to a hidden factor, and can distinguish constitutive from regulated gene expression. Conclusion: We have constructed a general chassis where three promoters from natural genes or components of synthetic networks can be easily inserted and independently monitored on a single construct using optimized fluorescent protein reporters. We have quantitatively characterized the baseline behavior of the chassis so that it can be used to measure dynamic gene regulation and noise. Overall, the system will be useful both for analyzing natural genetic networks and assembling synthetic ones.},

abstract = {One current challenge in metabolic systems biology is to map out the regulation networks that control metabolism. From progress in this area, we conclude that non-transcriptional mechanisms (e.g. metabolite-protein interactions and protein phosphorylation) are highly relevant in actually controlling metabolic function. Furthermore, recent results highlight more functions of enzymes and metabolites than currently appreciated in genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, thereby adding another level of complexity. Combining experimental analyses and modeling efforts we are also beginning to understand how metabolic behavior emerges. Particularly, we recognize that metabolism is not simply a dull workhorse process but rather takes very active control of itself and other cellular processes, rendering true system-level understanding of metabolism possibly more difficult than for other cellular systems.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new type of system to simulate conditions in the large intestine. This system combines removal of metabolites and water with peristaltic mixing to obtain and handle physiological concentrations of microorganisms, dry matter and microbial metabolites. The system has been designed to be complementary to the dynamic multi-compartmental system that simulates conditions in the stomach and small intestine described by Minekus et al. [Minekus M, Marteau P, Havenaar R, Huis in't Veld JHJ (1995) ATLA 23:197-209]. High densities of microorganisms, comparable to those found in the colon in vivo, were achieved by absorption of water and dialysis of metabolites through hollow-fibre membranes inside the reactor compartments. The dense chyme was mixed and transported by peristaltic movements. The potential of the system as a tool to study fermentation was demonstrated in experiments with pectin, fructo-oligosaccharide, lactulose and lactitol as substrates. Parameters such as total acid production and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) patterns were determined with time to characterize the fermentation. The stability of the microflora in the system was tested after inoculation with fresh fecal samples and after inoculation with a microflora that was maintained in a fermenter. Both approaches resulted in total anaerobic bacterial counts higher than 10(10) colony-forming units/ml with physiological levels of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium. The dry matter content was approximately 10{\%}, while the total SCFA concentration was maintained at physiological concentrations with similar molar ratios for acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid as measured in vivo.},

abstract = {The spatial organization of K-Ras proteins into nanoclusters on the plasma membrane is essential for high-fidelity signal transduction. The mechanism underlying K-Ras nanoclustering is unknown. We show here that K-Ras.GTP recruits Galectin-3 (Gal-3) from the cytosol to the plasma membrane where it becomes an integral nanocluster component. Importantly, we show that the cytosolic level of Gal-3 determines the magnitude of K-Ras.GTP nanoclustering and signal output. The beta-sheet layers of the Gal-3 carbohydrate recognition domain contain a hydrophobic pocket that may accommodate the farnesyl group of K-Ras. V125A substitution within this hydrophobic pocket yields a dominant negative Gal-3(V125A) mutant that inhibits K-Ras activity. Gal-3(V125A) interaction with K-Ras.GTP reduces K-Ras.GTP nanocluster formation, which abrogates signal output from the Raf/mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK; MEK) pathway. Gal-3(V125A) negatively regulates cell growth and reduces cellular transformation. Thus, regulation of K-Ras nanocluster formation and signal output by Gal-3 critically depends on the integrity of the Gal-3 hydrophobic pocket. These results show that Gal-3 overexpression in breast cancer cells, which increases K-Ras signal output, represents oncogenic subversion of plasma membrane nanostructure.},

abstract = {We present a minimal model of plasma membrane heterogeneity that combines criticality with connectivity to cortical cytoskeleton. The development of this model was motivated by recent observations of micron-sized critical fluctuations in plasma membrane vesicles that are detached from their cortical cytoskeleton. We incorporate criticality using a conserved order parameter Ising model coupled to a simple actin cytoskeleton interacting through point-like pinning sites. Using this minimal model, we recapitulate several experimental observations of plasma membrane raft heterogeneity. Small (r â¼ 20Â nm) and dynamic fluctuations at physiological temperatures arise from criticality. Including connectivity to the cortical cytoskeleton disrupts large fluctuations, prevents macroscopic phase separation at low temperatures (T â¤ 22Â°C), and provides a template for long-lived fluctuations at physiological temperature (TÂ = 37Â°C). Cytoskeleton-stabilized fluctuations produce significant barriers to the diffusion of some membrane components in a manner that is weakly dependent on the number of pinning sites and strongly dependent on criticality. More generally, we demonstrate that critical fluctuations provide a physical mechanism for organizing and spatially segregating membrane components by providing channels for interaction over large distances.},

abstract = {Microbes survive in a variety of nutrient environments by modulating their intracellular metabolism. Balanced growth requires coordinated uptake of carbon and nitrogen, the primary substrates for biomass production. Yet the mechanisms that balance carbon and nitrogen uptake are poorly understood. We find in Escherichia coli that a sudden increase in nitrogen availability results in an almost immediate increase in glucose uptake. The concentrations of glycolytic intermediates and known regulators, however, remain homeostatic. Instead, we find that $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, which accumulates in nitrogen limitation, directly blocks glucose uptake by inhibiting enzyme I, the first step of the sugar-phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS). This inhibition enables rapid modulation of glycolytic flux without marked changes in the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates by simultaneously altering import of glucose and consumption of the terminal glycolytic intermediate phosphoenolpyruvate. Quantitative modeling shows that this previously unidentified regulatory connection is, in principle, sufficient to coordinate carbon and nitrogen utilization.},

abstract = {Bactericidal antibiotics kill by different mechanisms as a result of a specific interaction with their cellular targets. Over the past few years, alternative explanations for cidality have been proposed based on a postulated common pathway, depending on the intracellular production of reactive oxygen species. Detection of hydroxyl radicals relies on staining with specific fluorescent dyes that can penetrate the cell and are detected using flow cytometry. Flow cytometry has become an important tool in microbiology to study characteristics of individual cells within large heterogeneous cellular populations. We show here that Escherichia coli treated with different bactericidal antibiotics exhibits increased autofluorescence when analyzed by flow cytometry. We present evidence suggesting that this change in autofluorescence is caused by altered cell morphology upon antibiotic treatment. Consistent with this view, mutant cells that fail to elongate upon norfloxacin treatment show no increased auto-fluorescence response. Finally, we present data demonstrating that changes in autofluorescence can impact the results with fluorescent probes when using flow cytometry and confound the findings obtained with specific dyes. In summary, recent findings that correlate the exposure to cidal antibiotics with the production of reactive oxygen species need to be reconsidered in light of such changes in autofluorescence. Conclusive evidence for an increase of hydroxyl radicals after treatment with such drugs is still missing.},

abstract = {The hyper-recombinogenic properties of an E. coli strain in which the recBCD genes have been replaced by lambda red recombination functions were exploited in the development of a general PCR-mediated gene replacement scheme for Escherichia coli. Linear DNA substrates generated by recombinant PCR are introduced by electroporation into strains containing the recBCDDelta::red substitution. This technique allows for gene replacement in E. coli without prior cloning of the gene of interest. In addition, the counter-selectable marker sacB has been used to construct unmarked precise gene deletions without the need to form sacB-containing plasmid integrates. In other experiments, electroporation of recBCDDelta::red strains with high concentrations of linear DNA fragments (derived from plasmid digests) gave linear transformation rates approaching 1{\%} of the survivors of electroporation. The placement of lambda red and gam at a locus in the chromosome other than recBCD (galK) resulted in a strain that was as hyper-rec as one containing the lambda red for recBCD substitution. The gene replacement technique described here has been used for the construction of deletion-substitution alleles of lacZ and sulA, as well as six genes important for general homologous recombination in E. coli. Three of these replacements were performed without prior cloning of the genes.},

abstract = {From molecules in cells to organisms in ecosystems, biological populations fluctuate due to the intrinsic randomness of individual events and the extrinsic influence of changing environments. The combined effect is often too complex for effective analysis, and many studies therefore make simplifying assumptions, for example ignoring either intrinsic or extrinsic effects to reduce the number of model assumptions. Here we mathematically demonstrate how two identical and independent reporters embedded in a shared fluctuating environment can be used to identify intrinsic and extrinsic noise terms, but also how these contributions are qualitatively and quantitatively different from what has been previously reported. Furthermore, we show for which classes of biological systems the noise contributions identified by dual-reporter methods correspond to the noise contributions predicted by correct stochastic models of either intrinsic or extrinsic mechanisms. We find that for broad classes of systems, the extrinsic noise from the dual-reporter method can be rigorously analyzed using models that ignore intrinsic stochasticity. In contrast, the intrinsic noise can be rigorously analyzed using models that ignore extrinsic stochasticity only under very special conditions that rarely hold in biology. Testing whether the conditions are met is rarely possible and the dual-reporter method may thus produce flawed conclusions about the properties of the system, particularly about the intrinsic noise. Our results contribute toward establishing a rigorous framework to analyze dynamically fluctuating biological systems.},

With the criteria of expression in at least one of three growth conditions examined, we predict 14,868 TSS candidates, including 5,574 internal to annotated genes (iTSS) and 5,495 TSS corresponding to potential antisense RNAs (asRNAs). We examined expression of 14 candidate asRNAs by northern analysis using RNA from wild-type E. coli and from strains defective for ribonucleases III and E, two RNases reported to be involved in asRNA processing. Interestingly, nine asRNAs detected as distinct bands by northern analysis were differentially affected by the rnc and rne mutations.

abstract = {Regulated activation of Ras by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) constitutes a key transduction step in signaling processes that control an array of fundamental cellular functions including proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The principle mechanism by which Ras is activated down stream of RTKs involves the stimulation of guanine nucleotide exchange by the ubiquitous guanine nucleotide exchange factor Son of sevenless (Sos). In resting conditions, Sos activity is constrained by intramolecular interactions that maintain the protein in an autoinhibited conformation. Structural, biochemical, and genetic studies have implicated the histone domain (Sos-H), which comprises the most N-terminal region of Sos, in the regulation of Sos autoinhibition. However, the molecular underpinnings of this regulatory function are not well understood. In the present study we demonstrate that Sos-H possesses in vitro and in vivo membrane binding activity that is mediated, in part, by the interactions between a cluster of basic residues and phosphatidic acid. This interaction is required for Sos-dependent activation of Ras following EGF stimulation. The inducible association of Sos-H with membranes contributes to the catalytic activity of Sos by forcing the domain to adopt a conformation that destabilizes the autoinhibitory state. Thus, Sos-H plays a critical role in governing the catalytic output of Sos through the coupling of membrane recruitment to the release of autoinhibition.},

Moreover, sex linkage has numerous evolutionary genetic implications. Here, I provide a coherent overview of sex-chromosome evolution and function based on recent data. Heteromorphic sex chromosomes are almost as widespread across the animal and plant kingdoms as sexual reproduction itself and an accumulating body of genetic data reveals interesting similarities, as well as dissimilarities, between organisms with XY or ZW sex-determination systems. Therefore, I discuss how patterns and processes associated with sex linkage in male- and female-heterogametic systems offer a useful contrast in the study of sex-chromosome evolution.},

abstract = {Microorganisms employ a wealth of gene regulatory mechanisms to adjust their growth programs to variations in the environment. It was pointed out long ago [Savageau M (1977) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 74: 5647-5651] that the particular mode of gene regulation employed may be correlated with the "demand" on the regulated gene, i.e., how frequently the gene product is needed in its natural habitat. An evolutionary "use-it-or-lose-it" principle was proposed to govern the choice of gene regulatory strategies. Here, we examine quantitatively the forces selecting for and against two opposing modes of gene regulation, in the context of an evolutionary model that takes genetic drift, mutation, and time-dependent selection into account. We consider the effect of time-dependent selection, with periods of strong selection alternating with periods of neutral evolution. Using a variety of analytical methods, we find the effective population size and the typical time scale of environmental variations to be key parameters determining the fitness advantage of the different modes of regulation. Our results support Savageau's use-it-or-lose-it principle for small populations with long time scales of environmental variations and support a complementary "wear-and-tear" principle for the opposite situation.},

abstract = {Proteins are the most versatile among the various biological building blocks and a mature field of protein engineering has lead to many industrial and biomedical applications. But the strength of proteins-their versatility, dynamics and interactions-also complicates and hinders systems engineering. Therefore, the design of more sophisticated, multi-component protein systems appears to lag behind, in particular, when compared to the engineering of gene regulatory networks. Yet, synthetic biologists have started to tinker with the information flow through natural signaling networks or integrated protein switches. A successful strategy common to most of these experiments is their focus on modular interactions between protein domains or domains and peptide motifs. Such modular interaction swapping has rewired signaling in yeast, put mammalian cell morphology under the control of light, or increased the flux through a synthetic metabolic pathway. Based on this experience, we outline an engineering framework for the connection of reusable protein interaction devices into self-sufficient circuits. Such a framework should help to 'refacture' protein complexity into well-defined exchangeable devices for predictive engineering. We review the foundations and initial success stories of protein synthetic biology and discuss the challenges and promises on the way from protein- to protein systems design.},

In addition, the activities of 16 enzymes, and the concentrations of 5 intracellular metabolites, were measured as a function of time in batch culture as well as continuous culture. It was found that flux through phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase and malic enzyme were up-regulated in the pykF- mutant as compared with the wild type, and acetate formation was significantly reduced in the mutant. In addition, flux through the phosphofructose kinase pathway was reduced and that through the oxidative pentose phosphate (PP) pathway increased in the mutant. This was evidenced by the corresponding enzyme activities, and the increase in the concentrations of phosphoenol pyruvate, glucose-6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate, etc. It was also found for continuous cultivation that the enzyme activities of the oxidative PP and Entner-Doudoroff pathways increased as the dilution rate increased for the pykF- mutant.

Cells receive stochastic signals, perform detection and transduction with stochastic biochemistry, and grow and die in stochastic environments. Here we review progress in going from the molecular details to the information-processing strategies cells use in their decision-making. Such strategies are fundamentally influenced by stochasticity. We argue that the cellular decision-making can only be probabilistic and occurs at three levels. First, cells must infer from noisy signals the probable current and anticipated future state of their environment. Second, they must weigh the costs and benefits of each potential response, given that future. Third, cells must decide in the presence of other, potentially competitive, decision-makers. In this context, we discuss cooperative responses where some individuals can appear to sacrifice for the common good. We believe that decision-making strategies will be conserved, with comparatively few strategies being implemented by different biochemical mechanisms in many organisms. Determining the strategy of a decision-making network provides a potentially powerful coarse-graining that links systems and evolutionary biology to understand biological design.},

abstract = {Chromosome replication and cell division of Escherichia coli are coordinated with growth such that wild-type cells divide once and only once after each replication cycle. To investigate the nature of this coordination, the effects of inhibiting replication on Z-ring formation and cell division were tested in both synchronized and exponentially growing cells with only one replicating chromosome. When replication elongation was blocked by hydroxyurea or nalidixic acid, arrested cells contained one partially replicated, compact nucleoid located mid-cell. Cell division was strongly inhibited at or before the level of Z-ring formation. DNA cross-linking by mitomycin C delayed segregation, and the accumulation of about two chromosome equivalents at mid-cell also blocked Z-ring formation and cell division. Z-ring inhibition occurred independently of SOS, SlmA-mediated nucleoid occlusion, and MinCDE proteins and did not result from a decreased FtsZ protein concentration. We propose that the presence of a compact, incompletely replicated nucleoid or unsegregated chromosome masses at the normal mid-cell division site inhibits Z-ring formation and that the SOS system, SlmA, and MinC are not required for this inhibition.},

abstract = {Gene expression is subject to random perturbations that lead to fluctuations in the rate of protein production. As a consequence, for any given protein, genetically identical organisms living in a constant environment will contain different amounts of that particular protein, resulting in different phenotypes. This phenomenon is known as "phenotypic noise." In bacterial systems, previous studies have shown that, for specific genes, both transcriptional and translational processes affect phenotypic noise. Here, we focus on how the promoter regions of genes affect noise and ask whether levels of promoter-mediated noise are correlated with genes' functional attributes, using data for over 60{\%} of all promoters in Escherichia coli. We find that essential genes and genes with a high degree of evolutionary conservation have promoters that confer low levels of noise. We also find that the level of noise cannot be attributed to the evolutionary time that different genes have spent in the genome of E. coli. In contrast to previous results in eukaryotes, we find no association between promoter-mediated noise and gene expression plasticity. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in bacteria, natural selection can act to reduce gene expression noise and that some of this noise is controlled through the sequence of the promoter region alone.},

abstract = {Microbes have evolved many strategies to adapt to changes in environmental conditions and population structures, including cooperation and competition. One apparently competitive mechanism is contact dependent growth inhibition (CDI). Identified in Escherichia coli, CDI is mediated by Two-Partner Secretion (TPS) pathway proteins, CdiA and CdiB. Upon cell contact, the toxic C-terminus of the TpsA family member CdiA, called the CdiA-CT, inhibits the growth of CDI(-) bacteria. CDI(+) bacteria are protected from autoinhibition by an immunity protein, CdiI. Bioinformatic analyses indicate that CDI systems are widespread amongst $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ proteobacteria and that the CdiA-CTs and CdiI proteins are highly variable. CdiI proteins protect against CDI in an allele-specific manner. Here we identify predicted CDI system-encoding loci in species of Burkholderia, Ralstonia and Cupriavidus, named bcpAIOB, that are distinguished from previously-described CDI systems by gene order and the presence of a small ORF, bcpO, located 5' to the gene encoding the TpsB family member. A requirement for bcpO in function of BcpA (the TpsA family member) was demonstrated, indicating that bcpAIOB define a novel class of TPS system. Using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, we show that these genes are expressed in a probabilistic manner during culture of Burkholderia thailandensis in liquid medium. The bcpAIOB genes and extracellular DNA were required for autoaggregation and adherence to an abiotic surface, suggesting that CDI is required for biofilm formation, an activity not previously attributed to CDI. By contrast to what has been observed in E. coli, the B. thailandensis bcpAIOB genes only mediated interbacterial competition on a solid surface. Competition occurred in a defined spatiotemporal manner and was abrogated by allele-specific immunity. Our data indicate that the bcpAIOB genes encode distinct classes of CDI and TPS systems that appear to function in sociomicrobiological community development.},

abstract = {Gene expression is significantly stochastic making modeling of genetic networks challenging. We present an approximation that allows the calculation of not only the mean and variance, but also the distribution of protein numbers. We assume that proteins decay substantially more slowly than their mRNA and confirm that many genes satisfy this relation by using high-throughput data from budding yeast. For a two-stage model of gene expression, with transcription and translation as first-order reactions, we calculate the protein distribution for all times greater than several mRNA lifetimes and thus qualitatively predict the distribution of times for protein levels to first cross an arbitrary threshold. If in addition the fluctuates between inactive and active states, we can find the steady-state protein distribution, which can be bimodal if fluctuations of the promoter are slow. We show that our assumptions imply that protein synthesis occurs in geometrically distributed bursts and allows mRNA to be eliminated from a master equation description. In general, we find that protein distributions are asymmetric and may be poorly characterized by their mean and variance. Through maximum likelihood methods, our expressions should therefore allow more quantitative comparisons with experimental data. More generally, we introduce a technique to derive a simpler, effective dynamics for a stochastic system by eliminating a fast variable.},

Diffusion in tumor ECS is important for delivery of anti-tumor drugs. The ECS in brain comprises â¼20{\%} of brain parenchymal volume and contains cell-cell gaps down to â¼50Â nm. We have developed fluorescence methods to quantify solute diffusion in the ECS, allowing measurements deep in solid tissues using microfiberoptics with micron tip size. Diffusion through the tortuous ECS in brain is generally slowed by â¼3-5-fold compared with that in water, with approximately half of the slowing due to tortuous ECS geometry and half due to the mildly viscous extracellular matrix (ECM). Mathematical modeling of slowed diffusion in an ECS with reasonable anatomical accuracy is in good agreement with experiment. In tumor tissue, diffusion of small macromolecules is only mildly slowed ({\textless}3-fold slower than in water) in superficial tumor, but is greatly slowed ({\textgreater}10-fold) at a depth of few millimeters as the tumor tissue becomes more compact. Slowing by ECM components such as collagen contribute to the slowed diffusion. Therefore, as found within cells, cellular crowding and highly tortuous transport can produce only minor slowing of diffusion in the ECS.},

abstract = {Negative feedback loops have been invoked as a way to control and decrease transcriptional noise. Here, we have built three circuits to test the effect of negative feedback loops on transcriptional noise of an autoregulated gene encoding a transcription factor (TF) and a downstream gene (DG), regulated by this TF. Experimental analysis shows that self-repression decreases noise compared to expression from a non-regulated promoter. Interestingly enough, we find that noise minimization by negative feedback loop is optimal within a range of repression strength. Repression values outside this range result in noise increase producing a U-shaped behaviour. This behaviour is the result of external noise probably arising from plasmid fluctuations as shown by simulation of the network. Regarding the target gene of a self-repressed TF (sTF), we find a strong decrease of noise when repression by the sTF is strong and a higher degree of noise anti-correlation between sTF and its target. Simulations of the circuits indicate that the main source of noise in these circuits could come from plasmid variation and therefore that negative feedback loops play an important role in suppressing both external and internal noise. An important observation is that DG expression without negative feedback exhibits bimodality at intermediate TF repression values. This bimodal behaviour seems to be the result of external noise as it can only be found in those simulations that include plasmid variation},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The proteome reflects the available cellular machinery to deal with nutrients and environmental challenges. The most common E. coli strain BL21 growing in different, commonly employed media was evaluated using a detailed quantitative proteome analysis. RESULTS: The presence of preformed biomass precursor molecules in rich media such as Luria Bertani supported rapid growth concomitant to acetate formation and apparently unbalanced abundances of central metabolic pathway enzymes, e.g. high levels of lower glycolytic pathway enzymes as well as pyruvate dehydrogenase, and low levels of TCA cycle and high levels of the acetate forming enzymes Pta and AckA. The proteome of cells growing exponentially in glucose-supplemented mineral salt medium was dominated by enzymes of amino acid synthesis pathways, contained more balanced abundances of central metabolic pathway enzymes, and a lower portion of ribosomal and other translational proteins. Entry into stationary phase led to a reconstruction of the bacterial proteome by increasing e.g. the portion of proteins required for scavenging rare nutrients and general cell protection. This proteomic reconstruction during entry into stationary phase was more noticeable in cells growing in rich medium as they have a greater reservoir of recyclable proteins from the translational machinery. CONCLUSIONS: The proteomic comparison of cells growing exponentially in different media reflected the antagonistic and competitive regulation of central metabolic pathways through the global transcriptional regulators Cra, Crp, and ArcA. For example, the proteome of cells growing exponentially in rich medium was consistent with a dominating role of phosphorylated ArcA most likely a result from limitations in reoxidizing reduced quinones in the respiratory chain under these growth conditions. The proteomic alterations of exponentially growing cells into stationary phase cells were consistent with stringent-like and stationary phase responses and a dominating control through DksA-ppGpp and RpoS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A goal of systems biology is the quantitative modelling of biochemical networks. Yet for many biochemical systems, parameter values and even the existence of interactions between some chemical species are unknown. It is therefore important to be able to easily investigate the effects of adding or removing reactions and to easily perform a bifurcation analysis, which shows the qualitative dynamics of a model for a range of parameter values.

RESULTS: We present Facile, a Perl command-line tool for analysing the dynamics of a systems biology model. Facile implements the law of mass action to automatically compile a biochemical network (written as, for example, E + S {\textless}-{\textgreater} C) into scripts for analytical analysis (Mathematica and Maple), for simulation (XPP and Matlab), and for bifurcation analysis (AUTO). Facile automatically identifies mass conservations and generates the reduced form of a model with the minimum number of independent variables. This form is essential for bifurcation analysis, and Facile produces a C version of the reduced model for AUTO.

CONCLUSION: Facile is a simple, yet powerful, tool that greatly accelerates analysis of the dynamics of a biochemical network. By acting at the command-line and because of its intuitive, text-based input, Facile is quick to learn and can be incorporated into larger programs or into automated tasks.},

abstract = {Gene regulatory circuits can use dynamic, and even stochastic, strategies to respond to environmental conditions. We examined activation of the general stress response mediated by the alternative sigma factor, $\sigma$(B), in individual Bacillus subtilis cells. We observed that energy stress activates $\sigma$(B) in discrete stochastic pulses, with increasing levels of stress leading to higher pulse frequencies. By perturbing and rewiring the endogenous system, we found that this behavior results from three key features of the $\sigma$(B) circuit: an ultrasensitive phosphorylation switch; stochasticity ("noise"), which activates that switch; and a mixed (positive and negative) transcriptional feedback, which can both amplify a pulse and switch it off. Together, these results show how prokaryotes encode signals using stochastic pulse frequency modulation through a compact regulatory architecture.},

abstract = {The cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent catabolite repression effect in Escherichia coli is among the most intensely studied regulatory processes in biology. However, the physiological function(s) of cAMP signalling and its molecular triggers remain elusive. Here we use a quantitative physiological approach to show that cAMP signalling tightly coordinates the expression of catabolic proteins with biosynthetic and ribosomal proteins, in accordance with the cellular metabolic needs during exponential growth. The expression of carbon catabolic genes increased linearly with decreasing growth rates upon limitation of carbon influx, but decreased linearly with decreasing growth rate upon limitation of nitrogen or sulphur influx. In contrast, the expression of biosynthetic genes showed the opposite linear growth-rate dependence as the catabolic genes. A coarse-grained mathematical model provides a quantitative framework for understanding and predicting gene expression responses to catabolic and anabolic limitations. A scheme of integral feedback control featuring the inhibition of cAMP signalling by metabolic precursors is proposed and validated. These results reveal a key physiological role of cAMP-dependent catabolite repression: to ensure that proteomic resources are spent on distinct metabolic sectors as needed in different nutrient environments. Our findings underscore the power of quantitative physiology in unravelling the underlying functions of complex molecular signalling networks.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the application to field measurements of time series methods developed on the basis of the theory of deterministic chaos. The major difficulties are pointed out that arise when the data cannot be assumed to be purely deterministic and the potential that remains in this situation is discussed. For signals with weakly nonlinear structure, the presence of nonlinearity in a general sense has to be inferred statistically. The paper reviews the relevant methods and discusses the implications for deterministic modeling. Most field measurements yield nonstationary time series, which poses a severe problem for their analysis. Recent progress in the detection and understanding of nonstationarity is reported. If a clear signature of approximate determinism is found, the notions of phase space, attractors, invariant manifolds, etc., provide a convenient framework for time series analysis. Although the results have to be interpreted with great care, superior performance can be achieved for typical signal processing tasks. In particular, prediction and filtering of signals are discussed, as well as the classification of system states by means of time series recordings.},

Live systems are surprisingly robust, as they are able to not only preserve their physicochemical architecture in the face of variable nutritional and environmental conditions, but also tolerate stochastic variability in the concentrations of their components, fix errors resulting from hazardous events, and make virtually perfect copies of themselves. These qualities have started to be comprehended in full only since the application of network theory formalisms to regulatory phenomena. This review addresses the distinct role of network architecture (topology, logic) and biochemical/kinetic parameters in the materialization of various archetypical robust gene expression circuits in prokaryotes. Some take-home lessons for the construction of artificial regulatory networks (one of the trademarks of synthetic biology) are to be derived from such state of affairs.},

abstract = {Germline maintenance in the nematode C. elegans requires global repressive mechanisms that involve chromatin organization. During meiosis, the X chromosome in both sexes exhibits a striking reduction of histone modifications that correlate with transcriptional activation when compared with the genome as a whole. The histone modification spectrum on the X chromosome corresponds with a lack of transcriptional competence, as measured by reporter transgene arrays. The X chromosome in XO males is structurally analogous to the sex body in mammals, contains a histone modification associated with heterochromatin in other species and is inactivated throughout meiosis. The synapsed X chromosomes in hermaphrodites also appear to be silenced in early meiosis, but genes on the X chromosome are detectably expressed at later stages of oocyte meiosis. Silencing of the sex chromosome during early meiosis is a conserved feature throughout the nematode phylum, and is not limited to hermaphroditic species.},

abstract = {Cell-to-cell variability in the molecular composition of isogenic, steady-state growing cells arises spontaneously from the inherent stochasticity of intracellular biochemical reactions and cell growth. Here, we present a general decomposition of the total variance in the copy number per cell of a particular molecule. It quantifies the individual contributions made by processes associated with cell growth, biochemical reactions, and their control. We decompose the growth contribution further into variance contributions of random partitioning of molecules at cell division, mother-cell heterogeneity, and variation in cell-cycle progression. The contribution made by biochemical reactions is expressed in variance generated by molecule synthesis, degradation, and their regulation. We use this theory to study the influence of different growth and reaction-related processes, such as DNA replication, variable molecule-partitioning probability, and synthesis bursts, on stochastic cell-to-cell variability. Using simulations, we characterize the impact of noise in the generation-time on cell-to-cell variability. This article offers a widely-applicable theory on the influence of biochemical reactions and cellular growth on the phenotypic variability of growing, isogenic cells. The theory aids the design and interpretation of experiments involving single-molecule counting or real-time imaging of fluorescent reporter constructs. {\textcopyright} 2014 Biophysical Society.},

@article{Sawle2011,
abstract = {We attempt to understand the origin of enhanced stability in thermophilic proteins by analyzing thermodynamic data for 116 proteins, the largest data set achieved to date. We compute changes in entropy and enthalpy at the convergence temperature where different driving forces are maximally decoupled, in contrast to the majority of previous studies that were performed at the melting temperature. We find, on average, that the gain in enthalpy upon folding is lower in thermophiles than in mesophiles, whereas the loss in entropy upon folding is higher in mesophiles than in thermophiles. This implies that entropic stabilization may be responsible for the high melting temperature, and hints at residual structure or compactness of the denatured state in thermophiles. We find a similar trend by analyzing a homologous set of proteins classified based only on the optimum growth temperature of the organisms from which they were extracted. We find that the folding free energy at the temperature of maximal stability is significantly more favorable in thermophiles than in mesophiles, whereas the maximal stability temperature itself is similar between these two classes. Furthermore, we extend the thermodynamic analysis to model the entire proteome. The results explain the high optimal growth temperature in thermophilic organisms and are in excellent quantitative agreement with full thermal growth rate data obtained in a dozen thermophilic and mesophilic organisms.},

Although the anionic phospholipid phosphatidylserine is comparatively abundant, its contribution to the surface charge of individual cellular membranes is unknown, partly because of the lack of reagents to analyze its distribution in intact cells. We developed a biosensor to study the subcellular distribution of phosphatidylserine and found that it binds the cytosolic leaflets of the plasma membrane, as well as endosomes and lysosomes. The negative charge associated with the presence of phosphatidylserine directed proteins with moderately positive charge to the endocytic pathway. More strongly cationic proteins, normally associated with the plasma membrane, relocalized to endocytic compartments when the plasma membrane surface charge decreased on calcium influx.},

abstract = {We have used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) devoid of Ras proteins to illustrate that they are essential for proliferation and migration, but not for survival, at least in these cells. These properties are unique to the Ras subfamily of proteins because ectopic expression of other Ras-like small GTPases, even when constitutively active, could not compensate for the absence of Ras proteins. Only constitutive activation of components of the Raf/Mek/Erk pathway was sufficient to sustain normal proliferation and migration of MEFs devoid of Ras proteins. Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/PTEN/Akt and Ral guanine exchange factor (RalGEF)/Ral pathways, either alone or in combination, failed to induce proliferation or migration of Rasless cells, although they cooperated with Raf/Mek/Erk signalling to reproduce the full response mediated by Ras signalling. In contrast to current hypotheses, Ras signalling did not induce proliferation by inducing expression of D-type Cyclins. Rasless MEFs had normal levels of Cyclin D1/Cdk4 and Cyclin E/Cdk2. However, these complexes were inactive. Inactivation of the pocket proteins or knock down of pRb relieved MEFs from their dependence on Ras signalling to proliferate.},

abstract = {Synthetic biology uses modeling to facilitate the design of new genetic constructions. In particular, it is of utmost importance to model the reaction of the cellular chassis when expressing heterologous systems. We constructed a mathematical model for the response of a bacterial cell chassis under heterologous expression. For this, we relied on previous characterization of the growth-rate dependence on cellular resource availability (in this case, DNA and RNA polymerases and ribosomes). Accordingly, we estimated the maximum capacities of the cell for heterologous expression to be 46{\%} of the total RNA and the 33{\%} of the total protein. To experimentally validate our model, we engineered two genetic constructions that involved the constitutive expression of a fluorescent reporter in a vector with a tunable origin of replication. We performed fluorescent measurements using population and single-cell fluorescent measurements. Our model predicted cell growth for several heterologous constructions under five different culture conditions and various plasmid copy numbers with significant accuracy, and confirmed that ribosomes act as the limiting resource. Our study also confirmed that the bacterial response to synthetic gene expression could be understood in terms of the requirement for cellular resources and could be predicted from relevant cellular parameters.},

abstract = {The amplification of DNA fragments, cloned between user-defined 5' and 3' end sequences, is a prerequisite step in the use of many current applications including massively parallel sequencing (MPS). Here we describe an improved method, called homopolymer tail-mediated ligation PCR (HTML-PCR), that requires very little starting template, minimal hands-on effort, is cost-effective, and is suited for use in high-throughput and robotic methodologies. HTML-PCR starts with the addition of homopolymer tails of controlled lengths to the 3' termini of a double-stranded genomic template. The homopolymer tails enable the annealing-assisted ligation of a hybrid oligonucleotide to the template's recessed 5' ends. The hybrid oligonucleotide has a user-defined sequence at its 5' end. This primer, together with a second primer composed of a longer region complementary to the homopolymer tail and fused to a second 5' user-defined sequence, are used in a PCR reaction to generate the final product. The user-defined sequences can be varied to enable compatibility with a wide variety of downstream applications. We demonstrate our new method by constructing MPS libraries starting from nanogram and sub-nanogram quantities of Vibrio cholerae and Streptococcus pneumoniae genomic DNA.},

The evolved FP, which we named small ultra-red FP (smURFP), covalently attaches a biliverdin (BV) chromophore without a lyase, and has 642/670-nm excitation-emission peaks, a large extinction coefficient (180,000 M(-1)cm(-1)) and quantum yield (18{\%}), and photostability comparable to that of eGFP. smURFP has significantly greater BV incorporation rate and protein stability than the bacteriophytochrome (BPH) FPs. Moreover, BV supply is limited by membrane permeability, and smURFPs (but not BPH FPs) can incorporate a more membrane-permeant BV analog, making smURFP fluorescence comparable to that of FPs from jellyfish or coral. A far-red and near-infrared fluorescent cell cycle indicator was created with smURFP and a BPH FP.},

In Drosophila males, the ribonucleoprotein Male-Specific Lethal (MSL) complex plays an important role in hyperactivation of the X-linked genes to equalize gene dosage differences between the sexes. It appears that X chromosome recognition by the MSL complex may be mediated through a combination of sequence-specificity and transcriptional activities. The resulting transcriptional up-regulation also seems to involve several mechanisms, encompassing both gene-specific and chromosome-wide approaches. Interestingly the histone H4 lysine 16 specific MOF histone acetyl transferase, a key MSL member that hyper-acetylates the male X chromosome, is also involved in gene regulation beyond dosage compensation. A comparison of Drosophila and mammalian systems reveals intriguing parallels in MOF behavior, and highlights the multidisciplinary nature of this enzyme.},

Here we simultaneously measured absolute mRNA and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

Known as the Warburg effect in the context of cancer growth, this phenomenon occurs ubiquitously for fast-growing cells, including bacteria, fungi and mammalian cells, but its origin has remained unclear despite decades of research. Here we study metabolic overflow in Escherichia coli, and show that it is a global physiological response used to cope with changing proteomic demands of energy biogenesis and biomass synthesis under different growth conditions. A simple model of proteomic resource allocation can quantitatively account for all of the observed behaviours, and accurately predict responses to new perturbations. The key hypothesis of the model, that the proteome cost of energy biogenesis by respiration exceeds that by fermentation, is quantitatively confirmed by direct measurement of protein abundances via quantitative mass spectrometry.},

@article{Petty2011,
abstract = {Dosage compensation is a specialized form of gene regulation that balances sex-chromosome linked gene expression between the sexes. In C. elegans, dosage compensation is achieved by the activity of the dosage compensation complex (DCC). The DCC binds along both X chromosomes in hermaphrodites to down-regulate gene expression by half, limiting X-linked gene products to levels produced in XO males. Sequence motifs enriched on the X chromosome play an important role in targeting the DCC to the X. However, these motifs are not strictly X-specific and therefore other factors, such as the chromatin environment of the X chromosome, are likely to aid in DCC targeting. Previously, we found that loss of HTZ-1 results in partial disruption of dosage compensation localization to the X chromosomes. We wanted to know whether other chromatin components coordinated with HTZ-1 to regulate DCC localization. One candidate is DPY-30, a protein known to play a role in DCC localization. DPY-30 homologs in yeast, flies, and mammals are highly conserved members of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methyltransferase Set1/MLL complexes. Therefore, we investigated the hypothesis that the dosage compensation function of DPY-30 involves H3K4 methylation. We found that in dpy-30 animals the DCC fails to stably bind chromatin. Interestingly, of all the C. elegans homologs of Set1/MLL complex subunits, only DPY-30 is required for stable DCC binding to chromatin. Additionally, loss of H3K4 methylation does not enhance DCC mislocalization in htz-1 animals. We conclude that DPY-30 and HTZ-1 have unique functions in DCC localization, both of which are largely independent of H3K4 methylation.},

abstract = {The C. elegans dosage compensation complex (DCC) reduces transcript levels from each of the two hermaphrodite X chromosomes to equalize X-linked gene expression to that of XO males. Several of the proteins that comprise the DCC are homologous to subunits of the evolutionarily conserved condensin complexes, which in most organisms function in mitotic and meiotic chromosome condensation. These include the DCC subunits MIX-1 and DPY-27, which belong to the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) family of proteins. Several of the C. elegans DCC subunits also perform double duty as members of the canonical meiotic and mitotic condensin complexes. Here, we review what is known about the C. elegans DCC and how study of this model might shed light on general mechanisms of domain-scale transcriptional regulation. We discuss how condensin-like complexes may be targeted to specific chromosomal locations for performance of their functions.},

abstract = {FtsZ is an essential division protein in bacteria that functions by forming a ring at midcell that mediates septation. To further study the function of the Z ring the effect of a temperature-sensitive mutation, ftsZ84(Ts), on ring dynamics and septal progression was examined. Shifting a strain carrying an ftsZ84(Ts) mutation to the nonpermissive temperature led to loss of Z rings within 1 min. Septal ingrowth was immediately inhibited, and sharply demarcated septa, present at the time of the shift, were gradually replaced by blunted septa. These results indicate that the Z ring is required throughout septation. Shifting filaments to permissive temperature led to a rapid localization of FtsZ84 at regular intervals. Included in these localization events were complete and partial rings as well as spots, although some of these eventually aborted. These results reveal the rapid dynamics of FtsZ localization and indicate that nucleation sites are formed in the absence of FtsZ function. Interestingly, Z rings could not reform at division sites that were constricted although they could reform at sites that had not begun constriction.},

abstract = {Fluorescent proteins (FPs) are widely used in biochemistry, biology and biophysics. For quantitative analysis of gene expression FPs are often used as marking molecules. Therefore, sufficient knowledge of maturation times and their affecting factors is of high interest. Here, we investigate the maturation process of the FPs GFP and mCherry expressed by the three closely related Escherichia coli strains of the Colicin E2 system, a model system for colicinogenic interaction. One strain, the C strain produces Colicin, a toxin to which the S strain is sensitive, and against which the R strain is resistant. Under the growth conditions used in this study, the S and R strain have similar growth rates, as opposed to the C strain whose growth rate is significantly reduced due to the toxin production. In combination with theoretical modelling we studied the maturation kinetics of the two FPs in these strains and could confirm an exponential and sigmoidal maturation kinetic for GFP and mCherry, respectively. Our subsequent quantitative experimental analysis revealed a high variance in maturation times independent of the strain studied. In addition, we determined strain dependent maturation times and maturation behaviour. Firstly, FPs expressed by the S and R strain mature on similar average time-scales as opposed to FPs expressed by the C strain. Secondly, dependencies of maturation time with growth conditions are most pronounced in the GFP expressing C strain: Doubling the growth rate of this C strain results in an increased maturation time by a factor of 1.4. As maturation times can vary even between closely related strains, our data emphasize the importance of profound knowledge of individual strains' maturation times for accurate interpretation of gene expression data.},

abstract = {The first in vivo measurements of a protein diffusion coefficient versus cytoplasmic biopolymer volume fraction are presented. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching yields the effective diffusion coefficient on a 1-mum-length scale of green fluorescent protein within the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli grown in rich medium. Resuspension into hyperosmotic buffer lacking K+ and nutrients extracts cytoplasmic water, systematically increasing mean biopolymer volume fraction, {\textless}phi{\textgreater}, and thus the severity of possible crowding, binding, and confinement effects. For resuspension in isosmotic buffer (osmotic upshift, or Delta, of 0), the mean diffusion coefficient, {\textless}D{\textgreater}, in cytoplasm (6.1 +/- 2.4 microm2 s(-1)) is only 0.07 of the in vitro value (87 microm2 s(-1)); the relative dispersion among cells, sigmaD/{\textless}D{\textgreater} (standard deviation, sigma(D), relative to the mean), is 0.39. Both {\textless}D{\textgreater} and sigmaD/{\textless}D{\textgreater} remain remarkably constant over the range of Delta values of 0 to 0.28 osmolal. For a Delta value of {\textgreater} or =0.28 osmolal, formation of visible plasmolysis spaces (VPSs) coincides with the onset of a rapid decrease in {\textless}D{\textgreater} by a factor of 380 over the range of Delta values of 0.28 to 0.70 osmolal and a substantial increase in sigmaD/{\textless}D{\textgreater}. Individual values of D vary by a factor of 9 x 10(4) but correlate well with f(VPS), the fractional change in cytoplasmic volume on VPS formation. The analysis reveals two levels of dispersion in D among cells: moderate dispersion at low Delta values for cells lacking a VPS, perhaps related to variation in phi or biopolymer organization during the cell cycle, and stronger dispersion at high Delta values related to variation in f(VPS). Crowding effects alone cannot explain the data, nor do these data alone distinguish crowding from possible binding or confinement effects within a cytoplasmic meshwork.},

abstract = {Accurately predicting noise propagation in gene networks is crucial for understanding signal fidelity in natural networks and designing noise-tolerant gene circuits. To quantify how noise propagates through gene networks, we measured expression correlations between genes in single cells. We found that noise in a gene was determined by its intrinsic fluctuations, transmitted noise from upstream genes, and global noise affecting all genes. A model was developed that explains the complex behavior exhibited by the correlations and reveals the dominant noise sources. The model successfully predicts the correlations as the network is systematically perturbed. This approach provides a step toward understanding and manipulating noise propagation in more complex gene networks.},

abstract = {The rapid emergence of bacterial strains resistant to multiple antibiotics is posing a growing public health risk. The mechanisms underlying the rapid evolution of drug resistance are, however, poorly understood. The heterogeneity of the environments in which bacteria encounter antibiotic drugs could play an important role. E.g., in the highly compartmentalized human body, drug levels can vary substantially between different organs and tissues. It has been proposed that this could facilitate the selection of resistant mutants, and recent experiments support this. To study the role of spatial heterogeneity in the evolution of drug resistance, we present a quantitative model describing an environment subdivided into relatively isolated compartments with various antibiotic concentrations, in which bacteria evolve under the stochastic processes of proliferation, migration, mutation and death. Analytical and numerical results demonstrate that concentration gradients can foster a mode of adaptation that is impossible in uniform environments. It allows resistant mutants to evade competition and circumvent the slow process of fixation by invading compartments with higher drug concentrations, where less resistant strains cannot subsist. The speed of this process increases sharply with the sensitivity of the growth rate to the antibiotic concentration, which we argue to be generic. Comparable adaptation rates in uniform environments would require a high selection coefficient (sÂ {\textgreater}Â 0.1) for each forward mutation. Similar processes can occur if the heterogeneity is more complex than just a linear gradient. The model may also be applicable to other adaptive processes involving environmental heterogeneity and range expansion.},

When the reaction probability at a given collision is unity, the Noyes rate theory provides an exact expression of the rate coefficient. For the general case with the reaction probability less than unity, Noyes assumed that successive recollision times between a tagged pair of reactants are decorrelated. We show that with this renewal assumption, the rate theory of Wilemski and Fixman yields the same rate coefficient expression as the Noyes theory. To evaluate the validity of the renewal assumption, we carry out molecular dynamics simulations. Contrary to the usual expectation, we find that the renewal assumption works better at higher particle densities. The present study shows that the rate coefficient for collision-induced hard-sphere reactions can be estimated with great accuracy by using the first recollision time distribution alone, regardless of the magnitude of the reaction probability at a given collision.},

abstract = {Control elements of the tetracycline-resistance operon encoded in Tn10 of Escherichia coli have been utilized to establish a highly efficient regulatory system in mammalian cells. By fusing the tet repressor with the activating domain of virion protein 16 of herpes simplex virus, a tetracycline-controlled transactivator (tTA) was generated that is constitutively expressed in HeLa cells. This transactivator stimulates transcription from a minimal promoter sequence derived from the human cytomegalovirus promoter IE combined with tet operator sequences. Upon integration of a luciferase gene controlled by a tTA-dependent promoter into a tTA-producing HeLa cell line, high levels of luciferase expression were monitored. These activities are sensitive to tetracycline. Depending on the concentration of the antibiotic in the culture medium (0-1 microgram/ml), the luciferase activity can be regulated over up to five orders of magnitude. Thus, the system not only allows differential control of the activity of an individual gene in mammalian cells but also is suitable for creation of "on/off" situations for such genes in a reversible way.},

abstract = {Molecular oxygen (O(2)) is the second most abundant gas in the Earth's atmosphere, but in many natural environments, its concentration is reduced to low or even undetectable levels. Although low-oxygen-adapted organisms define the ecology of low-oxygen environments, their capabilities are not fully known. These capabilities also provide a framework for reconstructing a critical period in the history of life, because low, but not negligible, atmospheric oxygen levels could have persisted before the "Great Oxidation" of the Earth's surface about 2.3 to 2.4 billion years ago. Here, we show that Escherichia coli K-12, chosen for its well-understood biochemistry, rapid growth rate, and low-oxygen-affinity terminal oxidase, grows at oxygen levels of â¤ 3 nM, two to three orders of magnitude lower than previously observed for aerobes. Our study expands both the environmental range and temporal history of aerobic organisms.},

abstract = {Biochemical and genetic data show that ribosomes closely follow RNA polymerases that are transcribing protein-coding genes in bacteria. At the same time, electron and fluorescence microscopy have revealed that ribosomes are excluded from the Escherichia coli nucleoid, which seems to be inconsistent with fast translation initiation on nascent mRNA transcripts. The apparent paradox can be reconciled if translation of nascent mRNAs can start throughout the nucleoid before they relocate to the periphery. However, this mechanism requires that free ribosomal subunits are not excluded from the nucleoid. Here, we use single-particle tracking in living E. coli cells to determine the fractions of free ribosomal subunits, classify individual subunits as free or mRNA-bound, and quantify the degree of exclusion of bound and free subunits separately. We show that free subunits are not excluded from the nucleoid. This finding strongly suggests that translation of nascent mRNAs can start throughout the nucleoid, which reconciles the spatial separation of DNA and ribosomes with cotranscriptional translation. We also show that, after translation inhibition, free subunit precursors are partially excluded from the compacted nucleoid. This finding indicates that it is active translation that normally allows ribosomal subunits to assemble on nascent mRNAs throughout the nucleoid and that the effects of translation inhibitors are enhanced by the limited access of ribosomal subunits to nascent mRNAs in the compacted nucleoid.},

The SOS response was the first DNA repair system described in Escherichia coli induced upon treatment of bacteria with DNA damaging agents arrest DNA replication and cell division. Induction of the SOS response involves more than forty independent SOS genes, most of which encode proteins engaged in protection, repair, replication, mutagenesis and metabolism of DNA. Under normal growth conditions the SOS genes are expressed at a basal level, which increases distinctly upon induction of the SOS response. The SOS-response has been found in many bacterial species (e.g., Salmonella typhimurium, Caulobacter crescentus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis), but not in eukaryotic cells. However, species from all kingdoms contain some SOS-like proteins taking part in DNA repair that exhibit amino acid homology and enzymatic activities related to those found in E. coli. but are not organized in an SOS system. This paper presents a brief up-to-date review describing the discovery of the SOS system, the physiology of SOS induction, methods for its determination, and the role of some SOS-induced genes.},

Most of the known physiological effects on translation are exerted at the level of polypeptide chain initiation. Research on initiation of translation over the past five years has yielded much new information, which can be divided into three main areas: (a) structure and function of initiation factors (including identification by sequencing studies of consensus domains and motifs) and investigation of protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions during initiation; (b) physiological regulation of initiation factor activities and (c) identification of features in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of messenger RNA molecules that regulate the selection of these mRNAs for translation.

The only protein-protein bridge, b1b, is formed by the two proteins, S13 and L5 of the small and large ribosomal subunits, respectively. B1b absorbs the largest movement during ratchet-like motion, and its two proteins reorganize in different constellations during this motion of the ribosome. Our results in this study of b1b in the Escherichia coli 70S ribosome suggest that the intrinsic molecular features of the bridging proteins allow the bridge to modulate the ratchet-like motion in a controlled manner. Additionally, another large subunit protein, L31, seems to participate with S13 and L5 in the formation, dynamics, and stabilization of this bridge.},

Compared to the wild type, its ppc mutant excreted little acetate and produced less carbon dioxide at the expense of a slower growth rate and a lower glucose uptake rate. Consequently, an improvement of the biomass yield on glucose was observed in the ppc mutant. Enzyme activity measurements revealed that isocitrate lyase activity increased by more than 3-fold in the ppc mutant. Some TCA cycle enzymes such as citrate synthase, aconitase and malate dehydrogenase were also upregulated, but enzymes of glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway were downregulated. The intracellular intermediates in the glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, therefore, accumulated, while acetyl coenzyme A and oxaloacetate concentrations decreased in the ppc mutant. The intracellular metabolic flux analysis uncovered that deletion of ppc resulted in the appearance of the glyoxylate shunt, with 18.9{\%} of the carbon flux being channeled via the glyoxylate shunt. However, the flux of the pentose phosphate pathway significantly decreased in the ppc mutant.},

abstract = {dpy-27 is an essential dosage compensation gene that acts to reduce expression of both hermaphrodite X chromosomes. The DPY-27 protein becomes specifically localized to the X chromosomes of wild-type XX embryos, but remains diffusely distributed throughout the nuclei of male (XO) embryos. In xol-1 mutant XO embryos that activate the XX mode of dosage compensation and die from inappropriately low X chromosome transcript levels, DPY-27 becomes localized to X. Therefore, sex specificity of the dosage compensation process is regulated at the step of DPY-27 X chromosome localization. DPY-27 exhibits striking similarity to proteins required for assembly and structural maintenance of Xenopus chromosomes in vitro and for segregation of yeast chromosomes in vivo. These findings suggest a link between global regulation of gene expression and higher order chromosome structure. We propose that DPY-27 implements dosage compensation by condensing the chromatin structure of X in a manner that causes general reduction of X chromosome expression.},

@article{Kortum2012,
abstract = {Thymocytes must transit at least two distinct developmental checkpoints, governed by signals that emanate from either the pre-T cell receptor (pre-TCR) or the TCR to the small G protein Ras before emerging as functional T lymphocytes. Recent studies have shown a role for the Ras guanine exchange factor (RasGEF) Sos1 at the pre-TCR checkpoint. At the second checkpoint, the quality of signaling through the TCR is interrogated to ensure the production of an appropriate T cell repertoire. Although RasGRP1 is the only confirmed RasGEF required at the TCR checkpoint, current models suggest that the intensity and character of Ras activation, facilitated by both Sos and RasGRP1, will govern the boundary between survival (positive selection) and death (negative selection) at this stage. Using mouse models, we have assessed the independent and combined roles for the RasGEFs Sos1, Sos2, and RasGRP1 during thymocyte development. Although Sos1 was the dominant RasGEF at the pre-TCR checkpoint, combined Sos1/RasGRP1 deletion was required to effectively block development at this stage. Conversely, while RasGRP1 deletion efficiently blocked positive selection, combined RasGRP1/Sos1 deletion was required to block negative selection. This functional redundancy in RasGEFs during negative selection may act as a failsafe mechanism ensuring appropriate central tolerance.},

@article{Malleshaiah2010,
abstract = {Evolution has resulted in numerous innovations that allow organisms to increase their fitness by choosing particular mating partners, including secondary sexual characteristics, behavioural patterns, chemical attractants and corresponding sensory mechanisms. The haploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae selects mating partners by interpreting the concentration gradient of pheromone secreted by potential mates through a network of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling proteins. The mating decision in yeast is an all-or-none, or switch-like, response that allows cells to filter weak pheromone signals, thus avoiding inappropriate commitment to mating by responding only at or above critical concentrations when a mate is sufficiently close. The molecular mechanisms that govern the switch-like mating decision are poorly understood. Here we show that the switching mechanism arises from competition between the MAPK Fus3 and a phosphatase Ptc1 for control of the phosphorylation state of four sites on the scaffold protein Ste5. This competition results in a switch-like dissociation of Fus3 from Ste5 that is necessary to generate the switch-like mating response. Thus, the decision to mate is made at an early stage in the pheromone pathway and occurs rapidly, perhaps to prevent the loss of the potential mate to competitors. We argue that the architecture of the Fus3-Ste5-Ptc1 circuit generates a novel ultrasensitivity mechanism, which is robust to variations in the concentrations of these proteins. This robustness helps assure that mating can occur despite stochastic or genetic variation between individuals. The role of Ste5 as a direct modulator of a cell-fate decision expands the functional repertoire of scaffold proteins beyond providing specificity and efficiency of information processing. Similar mechanisms may govern cellular decisions in higher organisms and be disrupted in cancer.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: RNA viruses are responsible for a variety of illnesses among people, including but not limited to the common cold, the flu, HIV, and ebola. Developing new drugs and new strategies for treating diseases caused by these viruses can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Mathematical modeling may be used to elucidate host-pathogen interactions and highlight potential targets for drug development, as well providing the basis for optimizing patient treatment strategies. The purpose of this work was to determine whether a genome-scale modeling approach could be used to understand how metabolism is impacted by the host-pathogen interaction during a viral infection. Escherichia coli/MS2 was used as the host-pathogen model system as MS2 is easy to work with, harmless to humans, but shares many features with eukaryotic viruses. In addition, the genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli is the most comprehensive model at this time. RESULTS: Employing a metabolic modeling strategy known as "flux balance analysis" coupled with experimental studies, we were able to predict how viral infection would alter bacterial metabolism. Based on our simulations, we predicted that cell growth and biosynthesis of the cell wall would be halted. Furthermore, we predicted a substantial increase in metabolic activity of the pentose phosphate pathway as a means to enhance viral biosynthesis, while a break down in the citric acid cycle was predicted. Also, no changes were predicted in the glycolytic pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Through our approach, we have developed a technique of modeling virus-infected host metabolism and have investigated the metabolic effects of viral infection. These studies may provide insight into how to design better drugs. They also illustrate the potential of extending such metabolic analysis to higher order organisms, including humans.},

abstract = {The control of gene expression involves complex mechanisms that show large variation in design. For example, genes can be turned on either by the binding of an activator (positive control) or the unbinding of a repressor (negative control). What determines the choice of mode of control for each gene? This study proposes rules for gene regulation based on the assumption that free regulatory sites are exposed to nonspecific binding errors, whereas sites bound to their cognate regulators are protected from errors. Hence, the selected mechanisms keep the sites bound to their designated regulators for most of the time, thus minimizing fitness-reducing errors. This offers an explanation of the empirically demonstrated Savageau demand rule: Genes that are needed often in the natural environment tend to be regulated by activators, and rarely needed genes tend to be regulated by repressors; in both cases, sites are bound for most of the time, and errors are minimized. The fitness advantage of error minimization appears to be readily selectable. The present approach can also generate rules for multi-regulator systems. The error-minimization framework raises several experimentally testable hypotheses. It may also apply to other biological regulation systems, such as those involving protein-protein interactions.},

abstract = {Diseases of the esophageal epithelium (EE), such as reflux esophagitis and cancer, are rising in incidence. Despite this, the cellular behaviors underlying EE homeostasis and repair remain controversial. Here, we show that in mice, EE is maintained by a single population of cells that divide stochastically to generate proliferating and differentiating daughters with equal probability. In response to challenge with all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), the balance of daughter cell fate is unaltered, but the rate of cell division increases. However, after wounding, cells reversibly switch to producing an excess of proliferating daughters until the wound has closed. Such fate-switching enables a single progenitor population to both maintain and repair tissue without the need for a "reserve" slow-cycling stem cell pool.},

abstract = {The Escherichia coli sulA gene product is a highly unstable protein, whose synthesis in response to DNA damage is associated with an inhibition of septation. Genetic evidence as well as sequence information suggests that the sulA gene is part of the E. coli SOS system and is induced after DNA damage. We have constructed a plasmid carrying only the sulA gene; this plasmid is stable only when it contains an amber mutation in the sulA structural gene. Using fragments of this plasmid, we have carried out in vitro transcription experiments and demonstrated one major start site for RNA transcription. We have mapped this initiation point to an adenylate residue 30 nucleotides before the protein start. Purified LexA protein completely abolishes this transcription, in agreement with the prediction made from the genetic and sequence information previously available.},

It is suitable for equilibrium or non-equilibrium systems, in or out of stationary state, including non-Markovian or externally driven systems.

abstract = {Mammals harbour a complex gut microbiome, comprising bacteria that confer immunological, metabolic and neurological benefits. Despite advances in sequence-based microbial profiling and myriad studies defining microbiome composition during health and disease, little is known about the molecular processes used by symbiotic bacteria to stably colonize the gastrointestinal tract. We sought to define how mammals assemble and maintain the Bacteroides, one of the most numerically prominent genera of the human microbiome. Here we find that, whereas the gut normally contains hundreds of bacterial species, germ-free mice mono-associated with a single Bacteroides species are resistant to colonization by the same, but not different, species. To identify bacterial mechanisms for species-specific saturable colonization, we devised an in vivo genetic screen and discovered a unique class of polysaccharide utilization loci that is conserved among intestinal Bacteroides. We named this genetic locus the commensal colonization factors (ccf). Deletion of the ccf genes in the model symbiont, Bacteroides fragilis, results in colonization defects in mice and reduced horizontal transmission. The ccf genes of B. fragilis are upregulated during gut colonization, preferentially at the colonic surface. When we visualize microbial biogeography within the colon, B. fragilis penetrates the colonic mucus and resides deep within crypt channels, whereas ccf mutants are defective in crypt association. Notably, the CCF system is required for B. fragilis colonization following microbiome disruption with Citrobacter rodentium infection or antibiotic treatment, suggesting that the niche within colonic crypts represents a reservoir for bacteria to maintain long-term colonization. These findings reveal that intestinal Bacteroides have evolved species-specific physical interactions with the host that mediate stable and resilient gut colonization, and the CCF system represents a novel molecular mechanism for symbiosis.},

abstract = {The RAS proteins and their downstream pathways play pivotal roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and cell death, but their physiological roles in human development had remained unknown. Noonan syndrome, Costello syndrome, and cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome are autosomal dominant multiple congenital anomaly syndromes characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, heart defects, musculocutaneous abnormalities, and mental retardation. A variety of mutations in protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 11(PTPN11) has been identified in 50{\%} of Noonan patients. Specific mutations in PTPN11 have been identified in LEOPARD (multiple lentigines, electrocardiographic conduction abnormalities, ocular hypertelorism, pulmonary stenosis, abnormal genitalia, retardation of growth, and sensorineural deafness) syndrome. In 2005, we discovered Harvey-RAS (HRAS) germline mutations in patients with Costello syndrome. This discovery provided a clue to identification of germline mutations in Kirsten-RAS (KRAS), BRAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 and 2 (MAP2K1/MAP2K2) in patients with CFC syndrome. These genes encode molecules in the RAS/RAF/MEK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, leading to a new concept that clinically related disorders, i.e., Noonan, Costello, and CFC syndromes are caused by dysregulation of the RAS/mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In the present review, we summarize mutations in HRAS, KRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1/2, and PTPN11, the phenotypes of patients with these mutations, the functional properties of mutants and animal models. Finally we suggest that disorders with mutations of molecules in the RAS/MAPK cascade (Noonan, LEOPARD, Costello, and CFC syndromes and neurofibromatosis type I) may be comprehensively termed "the RAS/MAPK syndromes." Details on mutations will be updated in the RAS/MAPK Syndromes Homepage (www.medgen.med.tohoku.ac.jp/RasMapk syndromes.html).},

abstract = {Cells need to adapt to dynamic environments. Yeast that fail to cope with dynamic changes in the abundance of glucose can undergo growth arrest. We show that this failure is caused by imbalanced reactions in glycolysis, the essential pathway in energy metabolism in most organisms. The imbalance arises largely from the fundamental design of glycolysis, making this state of glycolysis a generic risk. Cells with unbalanced glycolysis co-existed with vital cells. Spontaneous, non-genetic metabolic variability among individual cells determines which state is reached and consequently which cells survive. Transient ATP hydrolysis through futile cycling reduces the probability of reaching the imbalanced state. Our results reveal dynamic behavior of glycolysis and indicate that cell fate can be determined by heterogeneity purely at the metabolic level.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION Copy number alterations (CNAs) associated with cancer are known to contribute to genomic instability and gene deregulation. Integrating CNAs with gene expression helps to elucidate the mechanisms by which CNAs act and to identify the transcriptional downstream targets of CNAs. Such analyses can help to sort functional driver events from the many accompanying passenger alterations. However, the way CNAs affect gene expression can vary in different cellular contexts, for example between different subtypes of the same cancer. Thus, it is important to develop computational approaches capable of inferring differential connectivity of regulatory networks in different cellular contexts. RESULTS We propose a statistical deregulation model that integrates copy number and expression data of different disease subtypes to jointly model common and differential regulatory relationships. Our model not only identifies CNAs driving gene expression changes, but at the same time also predicts differences in regulation that distinguish one cancer subtype from the other. We implement our model in a penalized regression framework and demonstrate in a simulation study the feasibility and accuracy of our approach. Subsequently, we show that this model can identify both known and novel aspects of cross-talk between the ER and NOTCH pathways in ER-negative-specific deregulations, when compared with ER-positive breast cancer. This flexible model can be applied on other modalities such as methylation or microRNA and expression to disentangle cancer signaling pathways.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is quite important to understand how the central metabolism is regulated under nitrogen (N)- limitation as well as carbon (C)- limitation. In particular, the effect of C/N ratio on the metabolism is of practical interest for the heterologous protein production, PHB production, etc. Although the carbon and nitrogen metabolisms are interconnected and the overall mechanism is complicated, it is strongly desirable to clarify the effects of culture environment on the metabolism from the practical application point of view.

RESULTS: The effect of C/N ratio on the metabolism in Escherichia coli was investigated in the aerobic continuous culture at the dilution rate of 0.2 h-1 based on fermentation data, transcriptional RNA level, and enzyme activity data. The glucose concentration was kept at 10 g/l, while ammonium sulfate concentration was varied from 5.94 to 0.594 g/l. The resultant C/N ratios were 1.68 (100{\%}), 2.81(60{\%}), 4.21(40{\%}), 8.42(20{\%}), and 16.84(10{\%}), where the percentage values in brackets indicate the ratio of N- concentration as compared to the case of 5.94 g/l of ammonium sulfate. The mRNA levels of crp and mlc decreased, which caused ptsG transcript expression to be up-regulated as C/N ratio increased. As C/N ratio increased cra transcript expression decreased, which caused ptsH, pfkA, and pykF to be up-regulated. At high C/N ratio, transcriptional mRNA level of soxR/S increased, which may be due to the activated respiratory chain as indicated by up-regulations of such genes as cyoA, cydB, ndh as well as the increase in the specific CO2 production rate. The rpoN transcript expression increased with the increase in C/N ratio, which led glnA, L, G and gltD transcript expression to change in similar fashion. The nac transcript expression showed similar trend as rpoN, while gdhA transcript expression changed in reverse direction. The transcriptional mRNA level of glnB, which codes for PII, glnD and glnK increased as C/N ratio increases. It was shown that GS-GOGAT pathway was activated for gdhA mutant under N- rich condition. In the case of glnL mutant, GOGAT enzyme activity was reduced as compared to the wild type under N- limitation. In the case of gltB, D mutants, GDH and GS enzymes were utilized under both N- rich and N- limited conditions. In this case, the transcriptional mRNA level of gdhA and corresponding GDH enzyme activity was higher under N- limitation as compared to N- rich condition.

CONCLUSION: The metabolic regulation of E.coli was clarified under both carbon (C)- limitation and nitrogen (N)- limitation based on fermentation, transcriptional mRNA level and enzyme activities. The overall regulation mechanism was proposed. The effects of knocking out N- assimilation pathway genes were also clarified.},

abstract = {The guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras exists in solution in two different conformational states when complexed with different GTP analogs such as GppNHp or GppCH(2)p. State 1 has only a very low affinity to effectors and seems to be recognized by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, whereas state 2 represents the high affinity effector binding state. In this work we investigate Ras in complex with the physiological nucleoside triphosphate GTP. By polarization transfer (31)P NMR experiments and effector binding studies we show that Ras(wt){\textperiodcentered}Mg(2+){\textperiodcentered}GTP also exists in a dynamical equilibrium between the weakly populated conformational state 1 and the dominant state 2. At 278 K the equilibrium constant between state 1 and state 2 of C-terminal truncated wild-type Ras(1-166) K(12) is 11.3. K(12) of full-length Ras is {\textgreater}20, suggesting that the C terminus may also have a regulatory effect on the conformational equilibrium. The exchange rate (k(ex)) for Ras(wt){\textperiodcentered}Mg(2+){\textperiodcentered}GTP is 7 s(-1) and thus 18-fold lower compared with that found for the Ras{\textperiodcentered}GppNHp complex. The intrinsic GTPase activity substantially increases after effector binding for the switch I mutants Ras(Y32F), (Y32R), (Y32W), (Y32C/C118S), (T35S), and the switch II mutant Ras(G60A) by stabilizing state 2, with the largest effect on Ras(Y32R) with a 13-fold increase compared with wild-type. In contrast, no acceleration was observed in Ras(T35A). Thus Ras in conformational state 2 has a higher affinity to effectors as well as a higher GTPase activity. These observations can be used to explain why many mutants have a low GTPase activity but are not oncogenic.},

abstract = {In Escherichia coli, damage to DNA induces the expression of a set of genes known collectively as the SOS response. Part of the SOS response includes genes that repair DNA damage, but another part of the response coordinates DNA replication and septation to prevent untimely cell division. The classic SOS gene product that inhibits cell division is SfiA (or SulA), which binds to FtsZ and prevents septum formation until the DNA damage has been repaired. However, another pathway acts to coordinate DNA replication and cell division when sfiA, or the sfi-dependent pathway, is inoperative. Until recently, little was known of this alternative pathway, which is called the sfi-independent pathway. We report here that sfi-independent filamentation is suppressed by lexA(Ind-) mutations, suggesting that derepression of the LexA regulon is necessary for sfi-independent induction. However, expression of LexA-controlled genes is not sufficient; DNA damage is also required to induce this secondary pathway of cell division inhibition. Furthermore, we postulate that loss of the common regulatory circuitry of the sfi-dependent and sfi-independent pathways by recA or lexA mutants uncouples cell division and DNA replication.},

abstract = {Homologous DNA recombination is a fundamental, regenerative process within living organisms. However, in most organisms, homologous recombination is a rare event, requiring a complex set of reactions and extensive homology. We demonstrate in this paper that Beta protein of phage lambda generates recombinants in chromosomal DNA by using synthetic single-stranded DNAs (ssDNA) as short as 30 bases long. This ssDNA recombination can be used to mutagenize or repair the chromosome with efficiencies that generate up to 6{\%} recombinants among treated cells. Mechanistically, it appears that Beta protein, a Rad52-like protein, binds and anneals the ssDNA donor to a complementary single-strand near the DNA replication fork to generate the recombinant. This type of homologous recombination with ssDNA provides new avenues for studying and modifying genomes ranging from bacterial pathogens to eukaryotes. Beta protein and ssDNA may prove generally applicable for repairing DNA in many organisms.},

abstract = {The construction of artificial networks of transcriptional control elements in living cells represents a new frontier for biological engineering. However, biological circuit engineers will have to confront their inability to predict the precise behavior of even the most simple synthetic networks, a serious shortcoming and challenge for the design and construction of more sophisticated genetic circuitry in the future. We propose a combined rational and evolutionary design strategy for constructing genetic regulatory circuits, an approach that allows the engineer to fine-tune the biochemical parameters of the networks experimentally in vivo. By applying directed evolution to genes comprising a simple genetic circuit, we demonstrate that a nonfunctional circuit containing improperly matched components can evolve rapidly into a functional one. In the process, we generated a library of genetic devices with a range of behaviors that can be used to construct more complex circuits.},

abstract = {Bacterial contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is mediated by the CdiB/CdiA family of two-partner secretion proteins. CDI systems deploy a variety of distinct toxins, which are contained within the polymorphic C-terminal region (CdiA-CT) of CdiA proteins. Several CdiA-CTs are nucleases, suggesting that the toxins are transported into the target cell cytoplasm to interact with their substrates. To analyze CdiA transfer to target bacteria, we used the CDI system of uropathogenic Escherichia coli 536 (UPEC536) as a model. Antibodies recognizing the amino- and carboxyl-termini of CdiA(UPEC536) were used to visualize transfer of CdiA from CDI(UPEC536+) inhibitor cells to target cells using fluorescence microscopy. The results indicate that the entire CdiA(UPEC536) protein is deposited onto the surface of target bacteria. CdiA(UPEC536) transfer to bamA101 mutants is reduced, consistent with low expression of the CDI receptor BamA on these cells. Notably, our results indicate that the C-terminal CdiA-CT toxin region of CdiA(UPEC536) is translocated into target cells, but the N-terminal region remains at the cell surface based on protease sensitivity. These results suggest that the CdiA-CT toxin domain is cleaved from CdiA(UPEC536) prior to translocation. Delivery of a heterologous Dickeya dadantii CdiA-CT toxin, which has DNase activity, was also visualized. Following incubation with CDI(+) inhibitor cells targets became anucleate, showing that the D.dadantii CdiA-CT was delivered intracellularly. Together, these results demonstrate that diverse CDI toxins are efficiently translocated across target cell envelopes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It has long been recognized that analyzing the behaviour of the complex intracellular biological networks is important for breeding industrially useful microorganisms. However, because of the complexity of these biological networks, it is currently not possible to obtain all the desired microorganisms. In this study, we constructed a system for analyzing the effect of gene expression perturbations on the behavior of biological networks in Escherichia coli. Specifically, we utilized (13)C metabolic flux analysis ((13)C-MFA) to analyze the effect of perturbations to the expression levels of pgi and eno genes encoding phosphoglucose isomerase and enolase, respectively on metabolic fluxes.

RESULTS: We constructed gene expression-controllable E. coli strains using a single-copy mini F plasmid. Using the pgi expression-controllable strain, we found that the specific growth rate correlated with the pgi expression level. (13)C-MFA of this strain revealed that the fluxes for the pentose phosphate pathway and Entner-Doudoroff pathway decreased, as the pgi expression lelvel increased. In addition, the glyoxylate shunt became active when the pgi expression level was almost zero. Moreover, the flux for the glyoxylate shunt increased when the pgi expression level decreased, but was significantly reduced in the pgi-knockout cells. Comparatively, eno expression could not be decreased compared to the parent strain, but we found that increased eno expression resulted in a decreased specific growth rate. (13)C-MFA revealed that the metabolic flux distribution was not altered by an increased eno expression level, but the overall metabolic activity of the central metabolism decreased. Furthermore, to evaluate the impact of perturbed expression of pgi and eno genes on changes in metabolic fluxes in E. coli quantitatively, metabolic sensitivity analysis was performed. As a result, the perturbed expression of pgi gene had a great impact to the metabolic flux changes in the branch point between the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway, isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction, anaplerotic pathways and Entner-Doudoroff pathway. In contrast, the impact of perturbed eno expression to the flux changes in E. coli metabolic network was small.

CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the response of metabolic fluxes to perturbation to pgi expression was different from that to eno expression; perturbations to pgi expression affect the reaction related to the Pgi protein function, the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction, anaplerotic reactions and Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Meanwhile, eno expression seems to affect the overall metabolic activity, and the impact of perturbed eno expression on metabolic flux change is small. Using the gene expression control system reported here, it is expected that we can analyze the response and adaptation process of complex biological networks to gene expression perturbations.},

abstract = {We have developed a 'postprocessing' method for modeling biochemical processes such as protein folding under crowded conditions (Qin and Zhou 2009 Biophys. J. 97 12-19). In contrast to the direct simulation approach, in which the protein undergoing folding is simulated along with crowders, the postprocessing method requires only the folding simulation without crowders. The influence of the crowders is then obtained by taking conformations from the crowder-free simulation and calculating the free energies of transferring to the crowders. This postprocessing yields the folding free energy surface of the protein under crowding. Here the postprocessing results for the folding of three small proteins under 'repulsive' crowding are validated by those obtained previously by the direct simulation approach (Mittal and Best 2010 Biophys. J. 98 315-20). This validation confirms the accuracy of the postprocessing approach and highlights its distinct advantages in modeling biochemical processes under cell-like crowded conditions, such as enabling an atomistic representation of the test proteins.},

In Drosophila, the male-specific lethal (MSL) ribonucleoprotein complex mediates dosage compensation by upregulating transcription from the single male X chromosome approximately twofold. A key challenge is to understand how the MSL complex distinguishes the X chromosome from autosomes. Recent studies suggest that this occurs through a multi-step targeting mechanism that involves DNA sequence elements and epigenetic marks associated with transcription. This review will discuss the relative contributions of sequence elements and transcriptional marks to the complete pattern of MSL complex binding.},

Most of our knowledge stems from studies of yeast MAPK scaffolds, but the identification of such scaffolds in higher eukaryotes provided a new dimension to this field and led to exciting and promising new insights into the regulation of MAPK signaling. In this review, we shortly summarize the well-established basic functions of scaffolds in yeast and highlight concepts emerging from recent studies in yeast and higher eukaryotes. In particular, we discuss how scaffolds may actively influence MAPK signaling by inducing conformational changes of bound kinases or substrates, by controlling the localization of activated MAPK and the extent and output of MAPK activation, and by modulating MAPK kinetics through the recruitment of phosphatases or ubiquitin-ligases. Finally, we summarize the current knowledge of scaffold regulation, and how these events may be functionally important for MAPK signaling.},

abstract = {Activation of Ras proteins underlies functional decisions in diverse cell types. Two molecules, RasGRP and SOS, catalyze Ras activation in lymphocytes. Binding of active Ras to SOS' allosteric pocket markedly increases SOS' activity establishing a positive feedback loop for SOS-mediated Ras activation. Integrating in silico and in vitro studies, we demonstrate that digital signaling in lymphocytes (cells are "on" or "off") is predicated upon feedback regulation of SOS. SOS' feedback loop leads to hysteresis in the dose-response curve, which can enable a capacity to sustain Ras activation as stimuli are withdrawn and exhibit "memory" of past encounters with antigen. Ras activation via RasGRP alone is analog (graded increase in amplitude with stimulus). We describe how complementary analog (RasGRP) and digital (SOS) pathways act on Ras to efficiently convert analog input to digital output. Numerous predictions regarding the impact of our findings on lymphocyte function and development are noted.},

abstract = {The rod-shaped cells of the bacterium Myxococcus xanthus move uni-directionally and occasionally undergo reversals during which the leading/lagging polarity axis is inverted. Cellular reversals depend on pole-to-pole relocation of motility proteins that localize to the cell poles between reversals. We show that MglA is a Ras-like G-protein and acts as a nucleotide-dependent molecular switch to regulate motility and that MglB represents a novel GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family and is the cognate GAP of MglA. Between reversals, MglA/GTP is restricted to the leading and MglB to the lagging pole defining the leading/lagging polarity axis. For reversals, the Frz chemosensory system induces the relocation of MglA/GTP to the lagging pole causing an inversion of the leading/lagging polarity axis. MglA/GTP stimulates motility by establishing correct polarity of motility proteins between reversals and reversals by inducing their pole-to-pole relocation. Thus, the function of Ras-like G-proteins and their GAPs in regulating cell polarity is found not only in eukaryotes, but also conserved in bacteria.},

In cell membranes, there are examples of both Brownian and anomalous diffusion, with the latter likely produced by lipid-protein and protein-protein interactions. We conclude that the notion of universally anomalous diffusion in cells as a consequence of molecular crowding is not correct and that slowing of diffusion in cells is less marked than has been generally assumed.},

abstract = {The plasma membrane nanoscale distribution of H-ras is regulated by guanine nucleotide binding. To explore the structural basis of H-ras membrane organization, we combined molecular dynamic simulations and medium-throughput FRET measurements on live cells. We extracted a set of FRET values, termed a FRET vector, to describe the lateral segregation and orientation of H-ras with respect to a large set of nanodomain markers. We show that mutation of basic residues in helix alpha4 or the hypervariable region (HVR) selectively alter the FRET vectors of GTP- or GDP-loaded H-ras, demonstrating a critical role for these residues in stabilizing GTP- or GDP-H-ras interactions with the plasma membrane. By a similar analysis, we find that the beta2-beta3 loop and helix alpha5 are involved in a novel conformational switch that operates through helix alpha4 and the HVR to reorient the H-ras G-domain with respect to the plasma membrane. Perturbation of these switch elements enhances MAPK activation by stabilizing GTP-H-ras in a more productive signalling conformation. The results illustrate how the plasma membrane spatially constrains signalling conformations by acting as a semi-neutral interaction partner.},

abstract = {Quantitative single-cell time-lapse microscopy is a powerful method for analyzing gene circuit dynamics and heterogeneous cell behavior. We describe the application of this method to imaging bacteria by using an automated microscopy system. This protocol has been used to analyze sporulation and competence differentiation in Bacillus subtilis, and to quantify gene regulation and its fluctuations in individual Escherichia coli cells. The protocol involves seeding and growing bacteria on small agarose pads and imaging the resulting microcolonies. Images are then reviewed and analyzed using our laboratory's custom MATLAB analysis code, which segments and tracks cells in a frame-to-frame method. This process yields quantitative expression data on cell lineages, which can illustrate dynamic expression profiles and facilitate mathematical models of gene circuits. With fast-growing bacteria, such as E. coli or B. subtilis, image acquisition can be completed in 1 d, with an additional 1-2 d for progressing through the analysis procedure.},

SUMMARY While isolated motor actions can be correlated with activities of neuronal networks, an unresolved prob-lem is how the brain assembles these activities into organized behaviors like action sequences. Using brain-wide calcium imaging in Caenorhabditis ele-gans, we show that a large proportion of neurons across the brain share information by engaging in co-ordinated, dynamical network activity. This brain state evolves on a cycle, each segment of which re-cruits the activities of different neuronal sub-popula-tions and can be explicitly mapped, on a single trial basis, to the animals' major motor commands. This organization defines the assembly of motor com-mands into a string of run-and-turn action sequence cycles, including decisions between alternative be-haviors. These dynamics serve as a robust scaffold for action selection in response to sensory input. This study shows that the coordination of neuronal activity patterns into global brain dynamics underlies the high-level organization of behavior.},

abstract = {Complex regulatory networks orchestrate most cellular processes in biological systems. Genes in such networks are subject to expression noise, resulting in isogenic cell populations exhibiting cell-to-cell variation in protein levels. Increasing evidence suggests that cells have evolved regulatory strategies to limit, tolerate or amplify expression noise. In this context, fundamental questions arise: how can the architecture of gene regulatory networks generate, make use of or be constrained by expression noise? Here, we discuss the interplay between expression noise and gene regulatory network at different levels of organization, ranging from a single regulatory interaction to entire regulatory networks. We then consider how this interplay impacts a variety of phenomena, such as pathogenicity, disease, adaptation to changing environments, differential cell-fate outcome and incomplete or partial penetrance effects. Finally, we highlight recent technological developments that permit measurements at the single-cell level, and discuss directions for future research. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Transcription factors mediate gene regulation by site-specific binding to chromosomal operators. It is commonly assumed that the level of repression is determined solely by the equilibrium binding of a repressor to its operator. However, this assumption has not been possible to test in living cells. Here we have developed a single-molecule chase assay to measure how long an individual transcription factor molecule remains bound at a specific chromosomal operator site. We find that the lac repressor dimer stays bound on average 5 min at the native lac operator in Escherichia coli and that a stronger operator results in a slower dissociation rate but a similar association rate. Our findings do not support the simple equilibrium model. The discrepancy with this model can, for example, be accounted for by considering that transcription initiation drives the system out of equilibrium. Such effects need to be considered when predicting gene activity from transcription factor binding strengths.},

It is important to understand how these uniquely designed protein machines interact with DNA strands and how such interactions are modulated by the ATP-binding and -hydrolysis cycle.

Here we show, using in silico and in vivo analyses of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signalling, that Ras nanoclusters operate as sensitive switches, converting graded ligand inputs into fixed outputs of activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). By generating Ras nanoclusters in direct proportion to ligand input, cells build an analogue-digital-analogue circuit relay that transmits a signal across the plasma membrane with high fidelity. Signal transmission is completely dependent on Ras spatial organization and fails if nanoclustering is abrogated. A requirement for high-fidelity signalling may explain the non-random distribution of other plasma membrane signalling complexes.},

abstract = {A challenge to both understanding and modeling biochemical networks is integrating the effects of diffusion and stochasticity. Here, we use the theory of branching processes to give exact analytical expressions for the mean and variance of protein numbers as a function of time and position in a spatial version of an established model of gene expression. We show that both the mean and the magnitude of fluctuations are determined by the protein's Kuramoto length--the typical distance a protein diffuses over its lifetime--and find that the covariance between local concentrations of proteins often increases if there are substantial bursts of synthesis during translation. Using high-throughput data, we estimate that the Kuramoto length of cytoplasmic proteins in budding yeast to be an order of magnitude larger than the cell diameter, implying that many such proteins should have an approximately uniform concentration. For constitutively expressed proteins that live substantially longer than their mRNA, we give an exact expression for the deviation of their local fluctuations from Poisson fluctuations. If the Kuramoto length of mRNA is sufficiently small, we predict that such local fluctuations become approximately Poisson in bacteria in much of the cell, unless translational bursting is exceptionally strong. Our results therefore demonstrate that diffusion can act to both increase and decrease the complexity of fluctuations in biochemical networks.},

Recent advances have clarified the molecular nature of the Caenorhabditis elegans sex-determination signal, which tallies X-chromosome number relative to the ploidy and controls both the choice of sexual fate and the process of dosage compensation. Dissecting the sex signal has revealed molecular mechanisms by which small quantitative differences in intracellular signals are translated into dramatically different developmental fates. Recent experiments have also revealed fundamental principles by which C. elegans dosage compensation proteins recognize and bind X chromosomes of XX embryos to reduce gene expression. Dosage compensation proteins function not only in a condensin complex specialized for regulating X-chromosome gene expression, but also in distinct condensin complexes that control other chromosome-wide processes: chromosome segregation and meiotic crossover recombination. The reshuffling of interchangeable molecular parts creates independent machines with similar architecture but distinct biological functions.},

We distinguish different types of growth-rate dependencies by the mechanisms of regulation involved and the presence or absence of an effect of the gene product on growth. The latter can lead to growth feedback, feedback mediated by changes of the global state of the cell. Moreover, we discuss how growth rate dependence can be used as a guide to study the molecular implementation of physiological regulation.},

abstract = {Genetically identical cells exposed to the same environmental conditions can show significant variation in molecular content and marked differences in phenotypic characteristics. This variability is linked to stochasticity in gene expression, which is generally viewed as having detrimental effects on cellular function with potential implications for disease. However, stochasticity in gene expression can also be advantageous. It can provide the flexibility needed by cells to adapt to fluctuating environments or respond to sudden stresses, and a mechanism by which population heterogeneity can be established during cellular differentiation and development.},

Recent work has elucidated the contribution of condensin and cohesin to interphase genome organization, control of gene expression, metazoan development and meiosis. Despite these wide-ranging functions, several themes have come to light: both complexes establish higher-order chromosome structure by inhibiting or promoting interactions between distant genomic regions, both complexes influence the chromosomal association of other proteins, and both complexes achieve functional specialization by swapping homologous subunits. Emerging data are expanding the range of processes in which condensin and cohesin are known to participate and are enhancing our knowledge of how chromosome architecture is regulated to influence numerous cellular functions.},

@article{Gamba2005,
abstract = {The ability of cells to sense spatial gradients of chemoattractant factors governs the development of complex eukaryotic organisms. Cells exposed to shallow chemoattractant gradients respond with strong accumulation of the enzyme phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its D3-phosphoinositide product (PIP(3)) on the plasma membrane side exposed to the highest chemoattractant concentration, whereas PIP(3)-degrading enzyme PTEN and its product PIP(2) localize in a complementary pattern. Such an early symmetry-breaking event is a mandatory step for directed cell movement elicited by chemoattractants, but its physical origin is still mysterious. Here, we propose that directional sensing is the consequence of a phase-ordering process mediated by phosphoinositide diffusion and driven by the distribution of chemotactic signal. By studying a realistic reaction-diffusion lattice model that describes PI3K and PTEN enzymatic activity, recruitment to the plasma membrane, and diffusion of their phosphoinositide products, we show that the effective enzyme-enzyme interaction induced by catalysis and diffusion introduces an instability of the system toward phase separation for realistic values of physical parameters. In this framework, large reversible amplification of shallow chemotactic gradients, selective localization of chemical factors, macroscopic response timescales, and spontaneous polarization arise naturally. The model is robust with respect to order-of-magnitude variations of the parameters.},

abstract = {The Caenorhabditis elegans dosage compensation complex (DCC) equalizes X-chromosome gene dosage between XO males and XX hermaphrodites by two-fold repression of X-linked gene expression in hermaphrodites. The DCC localizes to the X chromosomes in hermaphrodites but not in males, and some subunits form a complex homologous to condensin. The mechanism by which the DCC downregulates gene expression remains unclear. Here we show that the DCC controls the methylation state of lysine 20 of histone H4, leading to higher H4K20me1 and lower H4K20me3 levels on the X chromosomes of XX hermaphrodites relative to autosomes. We identify the PR-SET7 ortholog SET-1 and the Suv4-20 ortholog SET-4 as the major histone methyltransferases for monomethylation and di/trimethylation of H4K20, respectively, and provide evidence that X-chromosome enrichment of H4K20me1 involves inhibition of SET-4 activity on the X. RNAi knockdown of set-1 results in synthetic lethality with dosage compensation mutants and upregulation of X-linked gene expression, supporting a model whereby H4K20me1 functions with the condensin-like C. elegans DCC to repress transcription of X-linked genes. H4K20me1 is important for mitotic chromosome condensation in mammals, suggesting that increased H4K20me1 on the X may restrict access of the transcription machinery to X-linked genes via chromatin compaction.},

abstract = {Transcriptional stochasticity can be measured by counting the number of mRNA molecules per cell. Cell-to-cell variability is best captured in terms of concentration rather than molecule counts, because reaction rates depend on concentrations. We combined single-molecule mRNA counting with single-cell volume measurements to quantify the statistics of both transcript numbers and concentrations in human cells. We compared three cell clones that differ only in the genomic integration site of an identical constitutively expressed reporter gene. The transcript number per cell varied proportionally with cell volume in all three clones, indicating concentration homeostasis. We found that the cell-to-cell variability in the mRNA concentration is almost exclusively due to cell-to-cell variation in gene expression activity, whereas the cell-to-cell variation in mRNA number is larger, due to a significant contribution of cell volume variability. We concluded that the precise relationship between transcript number and cell volume sets the biological stochasticity of living cells. This study highlights the importance of the quantitative measurement of transcript concentrations in studies of cell-to-cell variability in biology.},

We describe the application of this method to imaging bacteria by using an automated microscopy system. This protocol has been used to analyze sporulation and competence differentiation in Bacillus subtilis, and to quantify gene regulation and its fluctuations in individual Escherichia coli cells. The protocol involves seeding and growing bacteria on small agarose pads and imaging the resulting microcolonies. Images are then reviewed and analyzed using our laboratory's custom MATLAB analysis code, which segments and tracks cells in a frame-to-frame method. This process yields quantitative expression data on cell lineages, which can illustrate dynamic expression profiles and facilitate mathematical models of gene circuits. With fast-growing bacteria, such as E. coli or B. subtilis, image acquisition can be completed in 1 d, with an additional 1-2 d for progressing through the analysis procedure.},

abstract = {E. coli grow and divide faster than the time required to replicate its genome. This is accomplished using overlapping replication cycles where multiple parallel replication processes were initiated in previous generations. In addition, cells living under constant growth conditions vary considerably in their growth rates, cell cycle times and division sizes. In spite of these fluctuations, cells have to terminate one round of replication during each cycle. It has been unclear how cells accomplish this without cell cycle checkpoints, which, in turn, would be inconsistent with overlapping replication cycles. Using single molecule fluorescence microscopy to localize and track the replisome-protein DnaQ throughout thousands of bacterial cell cycles, we find that initiation of replication occurs at a fixed volume per origins independently of the time from division. This ratio is also constant for different growth conditions. Further, a model of the bacterial cell cycle, where division occurs a constant time after replication initiation, reproduces the variations in timing and sizes at divisions. The large cell-to-cell variation in these parameters mainly depends on variations in growth rates.},

abstract = {Individual cells in genetically homogeneous populations have been found to express different numbers of molecules of specific proteins. We investigated the origins of these variations in mammalian cells by counting individual molecules of mRNA produced from a reporter gene that was stably integrated into the cell's genome. We found that there are massive variations in the number of mRNA molecules present in each cell. These variations occur because mRNAs are synthesized in short but intense bursts of transcription beginning when the gene transitions from an inactive to an active state and ending when they transition back to the inactive state. We show that these transitions are intrinsically random and not due to global, extrinsic factors such as the levels of transcriptional activators. Moreover, the gene activation causes burst-like expression of all genes within a wider genomic locus. We further found that bursts are also exhibited in the synthesis of natural genes. The bursts of mRNA expression can be buffered at the protein level by slow protein degradation rates. A stochastic model of gene activation and inactivation was developed to explain the statistical properties of the bursts. The model showed that increasing the level of transcription factors increases the average size of the bursts rather than their frequency. These results demonstrate that gene expression in mammalian cells is subject to large, intrinsically random fluctuations and raise questions about how cells are able to function in the face of such noise.},

abstract = {Plasma membrane compartmentalization imposes lateral segregation on membrane proteins that is important for regulating signal transduction. We use computational modeling of immunogold spatial point patterns on intact plasma membrane sheets to test different models of inner plasma membrane organization. We find compartmentalization at the nanoscale level but show that a classical raft model of preexisting stable domains into which lipid raft proteins partition is incompatible with the spatial point patterns generated by the immunogold labeling of a palmitoylated raft marker protein. Rather, approximately 30{\%} of the raft protein exists in cholesterol-dependent nanoclusters, with approximately 70{\%} distributed as monomers. The cluster/monomer ratio (number of proteins in clusters/number of proteins outside clusters) is independent of expression level. H-rasG12V and K-rasG12V proteins also operate in nanoclusters with fixed cluster/monomer ratios that are independent of expression level. Detailed calibration of the immunogold imaging protocol suggests that radii of raft and RasG12V protein nanoclusters may be as small as 11 and 6 nm, respectively, and shows that the nanoclusters contain small numbers (6.0-7.7) of proteins. Raft nanoclusters do not form if the actin cytoskeleton is disassembled. The formation of K-rasG12V but not H-rasG12V nanoclusters also is actin-dependent. K-rasG12V but not H-rasG12V signaling is abrogated by actin cytoskeleton disassembly, which shows that nanoclustering is critical for Ras function. These findings argue against stable preexisting domains on the inner plasma membrane in favor of dynamic actively regulated nanoclusters similar to those proposed for the outer plasma membrane. RasG12V nanoclusters may facilitate the assembly of essential signal transduction complexes.},

The diversity of currently available fluorescent proteins covers nearly the entire visible spectrum, providing numerous alternative possibilities for multicolor labeling and studies of protein interactions. Photoactivatable fluorescent proteins enable tracking of photolabeled molecules and cells in space and time and can also be used for super-resolution imaging. Genetically encoded sensors make it possible to monitor the activity of enzymes and the concentrations of various analytes. Fast-maturing fluorescent proteins, cell clocks, and timers further expand the options for real time studies in living tissues.

abstract = {Regulation of metabolic operation in response to extracellular cues is crucial for cells' survival. Next to the canonical nutrient sensors, which measure the concentration of nutrients, recently intracellular "metabolic flux" was proposed as a novel impetus for metabolic regulation. According to this concept, cells would have molecular systems ("flux sensors") in place that regulate metabolism as a function of the actually occurring metabolic fluxes. Although this resembles an appealing concept, we have not had any experimental evidence for the existence of flux sensors and also we have not known how these flux sensors would work in detail. Here, we show experimental evidence that supports the hypothesis that Escherichia coli is indeed able to measure its glycolytic flux and uses this signal for metabolic regulation. Combining experiment and theory, we show how this flux-sensing function could emerge from an aggregate of several molecular mechanisms: First, the system of reactions of lower glycolysis and the feedforward activation of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate on pyruvate kinase translate flux information into the concentration of the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The interaction of this "flux-signaling metabolite" with the transcription factor Cra then leads to flux-dependent regulation. By responding to glycolytic flux, rather than to the concentration of individual carbon sources, the cell may minimize sensing and regulatory expenses.},

abstract = {Sister chromatid cohesion provides the mechanistic basis, together with spindle microtubules, for generating tension between bioriented chromosomes in metaphase. Pericentric chromatin forms an intramolecular loop that protrudes bidirectionally from the sister chromatid axis. The centromere lies on the surface of the chromosome at the apex of each loop. The cohesin and condensin structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) protein complexes are concentrated within the pericentric chromatin, but whether they contribute to tension-generating mechanisms is not known. To understand how pericentric chromatin is packaged and resists tension, we map the position of cohesin (SMC3), condensin (SMC4), and pericentric LacO arrays within the spindle. Condensin lies proximal to the spindle axis and is responsible for axial compaction of pericentric chromatin. Cohesin is radially displaced from the spindle axis and confines pericentric chromatin. Pericentric cohesin and condensin contribute to spindle length regulation and dynamics in metaphase. Together with the intramolecular centromere loop, these SMC complexes constitute a molecular spring that balances spindle microtubule force in metaphase.},

abstract = {Synthetic gene circuits are often engineered by considering the host cell as an invariable 'chassis'. Circuit activation, however, may modulate host physiology, which in turn can substantially impact circuit behavior. We illustrate this point by a simple circuit consisting of mutant T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP*) that activates its own expression in the bacterium Escherichia coli. Although activation by the T7 RNAP* is noncooperative, the circuit caused bistable gene expression. This counterintuitive observation can be explained by growth retardation caused by circuit activation, which resulted in nonlinear dilution of T7 RNAP* in individual bacteria. Predictions made by models accounting for such effects were verified by further experimental measurements. Our results reveal a new mechanism of generating bistability and underscore the need to account for host physiology modulation when engineering gene circuits.},

Understanding of these global effects is necessary for a quantitative understanding of gene regulation and for the design of synthetic genetic circuits. We find that the observed growth-rate dependence of constitutive gene expression can be explained by a simple model using the measured growth-rate dependence of the relevant cellular parameters. More complex growth dependencies for genetic circuits involving activators, repressors, and feedback control were analyzed and verified experimentally with synthetic circuits. Additional results suggest a feedback mechanism mediated by general growth-dependent effects that does not require explicit gene regulation if the expressed protein affects cell growth. This mechanism can lead to growth bistability and promote the acquisition of important physiological functions such as antibiotic resistance and tolerance (persistence).},

@article{Myers2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: UV-vis spectrophotometric optical density (OD) is the most commonly-used technique for estimating chromophore formation and cell concentration in liquid culture. OD wavelength is often chosen with little thought given to its effect on the quality of the measurement. Analysis of the contributions of absorption and scattering to the measured optical density provides a basis for understanding variability among spectrophotometers and enables a quantitative evaluation of the applicability of the Beer-Lambert law. This provides a rational approach for improving the accuracy of OD measurements used as a proxy for direct dry weight (DW), cell count, and pigment levels.

RESULTS: For pigmented organisms, the choice of OD wavelength presents a tradeoff between the robustness and the sensitivity of the measurement. The OD at a robust wavelength is primarily the result of light scattering and does not vary with culture conditions; whereas, the OD at a sensitive wavelength is additionally dependent on light absorption by the organism's pigments. Suitably robust and sensitive wavelengths are identified for a wide range of organisms by comparing their spectra to the true absorption spectra of dyes. The relative scattering contribution can be reduced either by measurement at higher OD, or by the addition of bovine serum albumin. Reduction of scattering or correlation with off-peak light attenuation provides for more accurate assessment of chromophore levels within cells. Conversion factors between DW, OD, and colony-forming unit density are tabulated for 17 diverse organisms to illustrate the scope of variability of these correlations. Finally, an inexpensive short pathlength LED-based flow cell is demonstrated for the online monitoring of growth in a bioreactor at culture concentrations greater than 5 grams dry weight per liter which would otherwise require off-line dilutions to obtain non-saturated OD measurements.

CONCLUSIONS: OD is most accurate as a time-saving proxy measurement for biomass concentration when light attenuation is dominated by scattering. However, the applicability of OD-based correlations is highly dependent on the measurement specifications (spectrophotometer model and wavelength) and culture conditions (media type; growth stage; culture stress; cell/colony geometry; presence and concentration of secreted compounds). These variations highlight the importance of treating literature conversion factors as rough approximations as opposed to concrete constants. There is an opportunity to optimize measurements of cell pigment levels by considering scattering and absorption-dependent wavelengths of the OD spectrum.},

abstract = {Homologous recombination is an important mechanism for the repair of DNA damage in mitotically dividing cells. Mitotic crossovers between homologues with heterozygous alleles can produce two homozygous daughter cells (loss of heterozygosity), whereas crossovers between repeated genes on non-homologous chromosomes can result in translocations. Using a genetic system that allows selection of daughter cells that contain the reciprocal products of mitotic crossing over, we mapped crossovers and gene conversion events at a resolution of about 4 kb in a 120-kb region of chromosome V of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The gene conversion tracts associated with mitotic crossovers are much longer (averaging about 12 kb) than the conversion tracts associated with meiotic recombination and are non-randomly distributed along the chromosome. In addition, about 40{\%} of the conversion events have patterns of marker segregation that are most simply explained as reflecting the repair of a chromosome that was broken in G1 of the cell cycle.},
annote = {p1.
*Mitotic recombination is infrequent (compared {\#}divsions) and selection both daughter cells were it occurred is hard.
*Can be done with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) markers (e.g. antibiotic). 
(Note this uses old school Mendel crossings with recessive genes.)
* Break induced DNA replication can also lead to recombination, but then only the broken DNA strand is affected (ie. the wrong template is used; fig. 1B).
* Conversion events are when information is not exchanged reciprocally.
(note: heteroduplex = DNA w. two non-identical strands, cq. hybdrid DNA.)

abstract = {Chromatin modifiers regulate lifespan in several organisms, raising the question of whether changes in chromatin states in the parental generation could be incompletely reprogrammed in the next generation and thereby affect the lifespan of descendants. The histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) complex, composed of ASH-2, WDR-5 and the histone methyltransferase SET-2, regulates Caenorhabditis elegans lifespan. Here we show that deficiencies in the H3K4me3 chromatin modifiers ASH-2, WDR-5 or SET-2 in the parental generation extend the lifespan of descendants up until the third generation. The transgenerational inheritance of lifespan extension by members of the ASH-2 complex is dependent on the H3K4me3 demethylase RBR-2, and requires the presence of a functioning germline in the descendants. Transgenerational inheritance of lifespan is specific for the H3K4me3 methylation complex and is associated with epigenetic changes in gene expression. Thus, manipulation of specific chromatin modifiers only in parents can induce an epigenetic memory of longevity in descendants.},

Here, for the first time, we extend TIR-FCS to a cellular application for measuring the lateral diffusion of a membrane-binding fluorescent protein, farnesylated EGFP, on the plasma membranes of cultured HeLa and COS7 cells. We detected two kinds of diffusional motion-fast three-dimensional diffusion (D(1)) and much slower two-dimensional diffusion (D(2)), simultaneously. Conventional FCS and single-molecule tracking confirmed that D(1) was free diffusion of farnesylated EGFP close to the plasma membrane in cytosol and D(2) was lateral diffusion in the plasma membrane.

abstract = {Noise in gene expression can lead to reversible phenotypic switching. Several experimental studies have shown that the abundance distributions of proteins in a population of isogenic cells may display multiple distinct maxima. Each of these maxima may be associated with a subpopulation of a particular phenotype, the quantification of which is important for understanding cellular decision-making. Here, we devise a methodology which allows us to quantify multimodal gene expression distributions and single-cell power spectra in gene regulatory networks. Extending the commonly used linear noise approximation, we rigorously show that, in the limit of slow promoter dynamics, these distributions can be systematically approximated as a mixture of Gaussian components in a wide class of networks. The resulting closed-form approximation provides a practical tool for studying complex nonlinear gene regulatory networks that have thus far been amenable only to stochastic simulation. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a number of genetic networks, uncovering previously unidentified dynamical characteristics associated with phenotypic switching. Specifically, we elucidate how the interplay of transcriptional and translational regulation can be exploited to control the multimodality of gene expression distributions in two-promoter networks. We demonstrate how phenotypic switching leads to birhythmical expression in a genetic oscillator, and to hysteresis in phenotypic induction, thus highlighting the ability of regulatory networks to retain memory.},

abstract = {The phage lambda-derived Red recombination system is a powerful tool for making targeted genetic changes in Escherichia coli, providing a simple and versatile method for generating insertion, deletion, and point mutations on chromosomal, plasmid, or BAC targets. However, despite the common use of this system, the detailed mechanism by which lambda Red mediates double-stranded DNA recombination remains uncertain. Current mechanisms posit a recombination intermediate in which both 5' ends of double-stranded DNA are recessed by $\lambda$ exonuclease, leaving behind 3' overhangs. Here, we propose an alternative in which lambda exonuclease entirely degrades one strand, while leaving the other strand intact as single-stranded DNA. This single-stranded intermediate then recombines via beta recombinase-catalyzed annealing at the replication fork. We support this by showing that single-stranded gene insertion cassettes are recombinogenic and that these cassettes preferentially target the lagging strand during DNA replication. Furthermore, a double-stranded DNA cassette containing multiple internal mismatches shows strand-specific mutations cosegregating roughly 80{\%} of the time. These observations are more consistent with our model than with previously proposed models. Finally, by using phosphorothioate linkages to protect the lagging-targeting strand of a double-stranded DNA cassette, we illustrate how our new mechanistic knowledge can be used to enhance lambda Red recombination frequency. The mechanistic insights revealed by this work may facilitate further improvements to the versatility of lambda Red recombination.},

Filamentous CdiA$\backslash$nexoproteins extend from CDI+ cells and bind specific receptors to$\backslash$ndeliver toxins into susceptible target bacteria. CDI has also been$\backslash$nimplicated in auto-aggregation and biofilm formation in several species,$\backslash$nbut the contribution of CdiA-receptor interactions to these$\backslash$nmulticellular behaviors has not been examined. Using Escherichia coli$\backslash$nisolate EC93 as a model, we show that cdiA and bamA receptor mutants are$\backslash$ndefective in biofilm formation, suggesting a prominent role for$\backslash$nCdiA-BamA mediated cell-cell adhesion. However, CdiA also promotes$\backslash$nauto-aggregation in a BamA-independent manner, indicating that the$\backslash$nexoprotein possesses an additional adhesin activity.

The$\backslash$nBamA-dependent and BamA-independent interaction domains map to distinct$\backslash$nregions within the CdiA filament. Thus, CdiA orchestrates a collective$\backslash$nbehavior that is independent of its growth-inhibition activity. This$\backslash$nadhesion should enable `greenbeard' discrimination, in which genetically$\backslash$nunrelated individuals cooperate with one another based on a single$\backslash$nshared trait.

Here we use LC-MS/MS to quantify more than 100 metabolite concentrations in aerobic, exponentially growing Escherichia coli with glucose, glycerol or acetate as the carbon source. The total observed intracellular metabolite pool was approximately 300 mM. A small number of metabolites dominate the metabolome on a molar basis, with glutamate being the most abundant. Metabolite concentration exceeds K(m) for most substrate-enzyme pairs. An exception is lower glycolysis, where concentrations of intermediates are near the K(m) of their consuming enzymes and all reactions are near equilibrium. This may facilitate efficient flux reversibility given thermodynamic and osmotic constraints. The data and analyses presented here highlight the ability to identify organizing metabolic principles from systems-level absolute metabolite concentration data.},

abstract = {All insects possess homologous segments, but segment specification differs radically among insect orders. In Drosophila, maternal morphogens control the patterned activation of gap genes, which encode transcriptional regulators that shape the patterned expression of pair-rule genes. This patterning cascade takes place before cellularization. Pair-rule gene products subsequently 'imprint' segment polarity genes with reiterated patterns, thus defining the primordial segments. This mechanism must be greatly modified in insect groups in which many segments emerge only after cellularization. In beetles and parasitic wasps, for instance, pair-rule homologues are expressed in patterns consistent with roles during segmentation, but these patterns emerge within cellular fields. In contrast, although in locusts pair-rule homologues may not control segmentation, some segment polarity genes and their interactions are conserved. Perhaps segmentation is modular, with each module autonomously expressing a characteristic intrinsic behaviour in response to transient stimuli. If so, evolution could rearrange inputs to modules without changing their intrinsic behaviours. Here we suggest, using computer simulations, that the Drosophila segment polarity genes constitute such a module, and that this module is resistant to variations in the kinetic constants that govern its behaviour.},

abstract = {The intracellular environment is crowded with proteins, DNA, and other macromolecules. Under physiological conditions, macromolecular crowding can alter both molecular diffusion and the equilibria of bimolecular reactions and therefore is likely to have a significant effect on the function of biochemical networks. We propose a simple way to model the effects of macromolecular crowding on biochemical networks via an appropriate scaling of bimolecular association and dissociation rates. We use this approach, in combination with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, to analyze the effects of crowding on a constitutively expressed gene, a repressed gene, and a model for the bacteriophage $\lambda$ genetic switch, in the presence and absence of nonspecific binding of transcription factors to genomic DNA. Our results show that the effects of crowding are mainly caused by the shift of association-dissociation equilibria rather than the slowing down of protein diffusion, and that macromolecular crowding can have relevant and counterintuitive effects on biochemical network performance.},

We integrate single-cell experiments with stochastic analyses, to identify predictive models of transcriptional dynamics for the osmotic stress response pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We generate models with varying complexity and use parameter estimation and cross-validation analyses to select the most predictive model. This model yields insight into several dynamical features, including multistep regulation and switchlike activation for several osmosensitive genes. Furthermore, the model correctly predicts the transcriptional dynamics of cells in response to different environmental and genetic perturbations. Because our approach is general, it should facilitate a predictive understanding for signal-activated transcription of other genes in other pathways or organisms.},

abstract = {CRP (cAMP receptor protein), the global regulator of genes for carbon source utilization in the absence of glucose, is the best-studied prokaryotic transcription factor. A total of 195 target promoters on the Escherichia coli genome have been proposed to be under the control of cAMP-bound CRP. Using the newly developed Genomic SELEX screening system of transcription factor-binding sequences, however, we have identified a total of at least 254 CRP-binding sites. Based on their location on the E. coli genome, we predict a total of at least 183 novel regulation target operons, altogether with the 195 hitherto known targets, reaching to the minimum of 378 promoters as the regulation targets of cAMP-CRP. All the promoters selected from the newly identified targets and examined by using the lacZ reporter assay were found to be under the control of CRP, indicating that the Genomic SELEX screening allowed to identify the CRP targets with high accuracy. Based on the functions of novel target genes, we conclude that CRP plays a key regulatory role in the whole processes from the selective transport of carbon sources, the glycolysis-gluconeogenesis switching to the metabolisms downstream of glycolysis, including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) pathway and aerobic respiration. One unique regulation mode is that a single and the same CRP molecule bound within intergenic regions often regulates both of divergently transcribed operons.},

Here we report on a simulation study aimed at evaluating the effects of crowding on internal protein dynamics, based on fully all-atom descriptions of the protein, the solvent and the crowder. Our model system consists of ubiquitin, a protein whose dynamic features are closely related to its ability to bind to multiple partners, in a 325Â g L(-1)Â solution of glucose in water, a condition widely employed in in vitro studies of crowding effects. We observe a slight reduction in loop flexibility accompanied by a dramatic restriction of the conformational space explored in the timescale of the simulations (â¼0.5Â Âµs), indicating that crowding slows down collective motions and the rate of exploration of the conformational space. This effect is attributed to the extensive and long-lasting interactions observed between protein residues and glucose molecules throughout the entire protein surface. Potential implications of the observed effects are discussed.},

In the presence of ATP, a single condensin complex is capable of introducing two or more compensatory supercoils into the protein-free region of a closed circular DNA. Within the condensin-bound region, approximately 190 bp of DNA is organized into a compact structure with two distinct domains, indicative of the formation of two oriented gyres.

abstract = {Plant infection by oomycete pathogens is a complex process. It requires precise expression of a plethora of genes in the pathogen that contribute to a successful interaction with the host. Whereas much effort has been made to uncover the molecular systems underlying this infection process, mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the genes involved remain largely unknown. We performed the first systematic de-novo DNA motif discovery analysis in Phytophthora. To this end, we utilized the genome sequence of the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans and two related Phytophthora species (P. ramorum and P. sojae), as well as genome-wide in planta gene expression data to systematically predict 19 conserved DNA motifs. This catalog describes common eukaryotic promoter elements whose functionality is supported by the presence of orthologs of known general transcription factors. Together with strong functional enrichment of the common promoter elements towards effector genes involved in pathogenicity, we obtained a new and expanded picture of the promoter structure in P. infestans. More intriguingly, we identified specific DNA motifs that are either highly abundant or whose presence is significantly correlated with gene expression levels during infection. Several of these motifs are observed upstream of genes encoding transporters, RXLR effectors, but also transcriptional regulators. Motifs that are observed upstream of known pathogenicity-related genes are potentially important binding sites for transcription factors. Our analyses add substantial knowledge to the as of yet virtually unexplored question regarding general and specific gene regulation in this important class of pathogens. We propose hypotheses on the effects of cis-regulatory motifs on the gene regulation of pathogenicity-related genes and pinpoint motifs that are prime targets for further experimental validation.},

abstract = {In individual cells, transcription is a random process obeying single-molecule kinetics. Often, it occurs in a bursty, intermittent manner. The frequency and size of these bursts affect the magnitude of temporal fluctuations in messenger RNA and protein content within a cell, creating variation or ânoiseâ in gene expression. It is still unclear to what degree transcriptional kinetics are specific to each gene and determined by its promoter sequence. Alternative scenarios have been proposed, in which the kinetics of transcription are governed by cellular constraints and follow universal rules across the genome. Evidence from genome-wide noise studies and from systematic perturbations of promoter sequences suggest that both scenariosânamely gene-specific versus genome-wide regulation of transcription kineticsâmay be present to different degrees in bacteria, yeast, and animal cells.},

abstract = {A low-error 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing method, in combination with whole-genome sequencing of {\textgreater}500 cultured isolates, was used to characterize bacterial strain composition in the fecal microbiota of 37 U.S. adults sampled for up to 5 years. Microbiota stability followed a power-law function, which when extrapolated suggests that most strains in an individual are residents for decades. Shared strains were recovered from family members but not from unrelated individuals. Sampling of individuals who consumed a monotonous liquid diet for up to 32 weeks indicated that changes in strain composition were better predicted by changes in weight than by differences in sampling interval. This combination of stability and responsiveness to physiologic change confirms the potential of the gut microbiota as a diagnostic tool and therapeutic target.},

@incollection{Eunen2011,
abstract = {Regulation analysis is a methodology that quantifies to what extent a change in the flux through a metabolic pathway is regulated by either gene expression or metabolism. Two extensions to regulation analysis were developed over the past years: (i) the regulation of Vmax can be dissected into the various levels of the gene-expression cascade, such as transcription, translation, protein degradation, etc. and (ii) a time-dependent version allows following flux regulation when cells adapt to changes in their environment. The methodology of the original form of regulation analysis as well as of the two extensions will be described in detail. In addition, we will show what is needed to apply regulation analysis in practice. Studies in which the different versions of regulation analysis were applied revealed that flux regulation was distributed over various processes and depended on time, enzyme, and condition of interest. In the case of the regulation of glycolysis in baker's yeast, it appeared, however, that cells that remain under respirofermentative conditions during a physiological challenge tend to invoke more gene-expression regulation, while a shift between respirofermentative and respiratory conditions invokes an important contribution of metabolic regulation. The complexity of the regulation observed in these studies raises the question what is the advantage of this highly distributed and condition-dependent flux regulation.},

@article{Schoenfelder2010,
abstract = {Transcription in the eukaryotic nucleus has long been thought of as conforming to a model in which RNA polymerase complexes are recruited to and track along isolated templates. However, a more dynamic role for chromatin in transcriptional regulation is materializing: enhancer elements interact with promoters forming loops that often bridge considerable distances and genomic loci, even located on different chromosomes, undergo chromosomal associations. These associations amass to form an extensive 'transcriptional interactome', enacted at functional subnuclear compartments, to which genes dynamically relocate. The emerging view is that long-range chromosomal associations between genomic regions, and their repositioning in the three-dimensional space of the nucleus, are key contributors to the regulation of gene expression.},

abstract = {Many animal species use a chromosome-based mechanism of sex determination, which has led to the coordinate evolution of dosage-compensation systems. Dosage compensation not only corrects the imbalance in the number of X chromosomes between the sexes but also is hypothesized to correct dosage imbalance within cells that is due to monoallelic X-linked expression and biallelic autosomal expression, by upregulating X-linked genes twofold (termed 'Ohno's hypothesis'). Although this hypothesis is well supported by expression analyses of individual X-linked genes and by microarray-based transcriptome analyses, it was challenged by a recent study using RNA sequencing and proteomics. We obtained new, independent RNA-seq data, measured RNA polymerase distribution and reanalyzed published expression data in mammals, C. elegans and Drosophila. Our analyses, which take into account the skewed gene content of the X chromosome, support the hypothesis of upregulation of expressed X-linked genes to balance expression of the genome.},

abstract = {Understanding how complex phenotypes arise from individual molecules and their interactions is a primary challenge in biology that computational approaches are poised to tackle. We report a whole-cell computational model of the life cycle of the human pathogen Mycoplasma genitalium that includes all of its molecular components and their interactions. An integrative approach to modeling that combines diverse mathematics enabled the simultaneous inclusion of fundamentally different cellular processes and experimental measurements. Our whole-cell model accounts for all annotated gene functions and was validated against a broad range of data. The model provides insights into many previously unobserved cellular behaviors, including in vivo rates of protein-DNA association and an inverse relationship between the durations of DNA replication initiation and replication. In addition, experimental analysis directed by model predictions identified previously undetected kinetic parameters and biological functions. We conclude that comprehensive whole-cell models can be used to facilitate biological discovery. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Heidinger-Pauli2010,
abstract = {Cohesin's complex distribution on chromosomes and its implication in numerous cellular processes makes it an excellent paradigm for studying the relationship between the in vivo concentration of a protein and its in vivo function. Here, we report a method to generate systematic quantized reductions (QR) in the in vivo concentration of any yeast protein. With QR, we generate strains with 13{\%} and 30{\%} of wild-type levels of the limiting subunit of cohesin, Mcd1p/Scc1p/Rad21p. Reducing cohesin levels reveals a preferential binding of cohesin to pericentric regions over cohesin-associated regions (CAR) on chromosome arms. Chromosome condensation, repetitive DNA stability, and DNA repair are compromised by decreasing cohesin levels to 30{\%} of wild-type levels. In contrast, sister-chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation are unaffected even when cohesin levels are reduced to 13{\%} of wild-type levels. The requirement for different in vivo cohesin concentrations to achieve distinct cohesin functions provides an explanation for how cohesin mutations can specifically lead to adult disorders such as Cornelia de Lange Syndrome and Roberts Syndrome without compromising the cell divisions needed for development and maturation. Our successful application of QR to cohesin suggests that QR is a powerful tool to study other proteins/pathways with multiple functions.},

@article{Shu2010,
abstract = {MAPkinase signalling is essential for cell growth, differentiation and cell physiology. G proteins and tyrosine kinase receptors each modulate MAPkinase signalling through distinct pathways. We report here that RGS14 is an integrator of G protein and MAPKinase signalling pathways. RGS14 contains a GPR/GoLoco (GL) domain that forms a stable complex with inactive Gialpha1/3-GDP, and a tandem (R1, R2) Ras binding domain (RBD). We find that RGS14 binds and regulates the subcellular localization and activities of H-Ras and Raf kinases in cells. Activated H-Ras binds RGS14 at the R1 RBD to form a stable complex at cell membranes. RGS14 also co-localizes with and forms a complex with Raf kinases in cells. The regulatory region of Raf-1 binds the RBD region of RGS14, and H-Ras and Raf each facilitate one another's binding to RGS14. RGS14 selectively inhibits PDGF-, but not EGF- or serum-stimulated Erk phosphorylation. This inhibition is dependent on H-Ras binding to RGS14 and is reversed by co-expression of Gialpha1, which binds and recruits RGS14 to the plasma membrane. Gialpha1 binding to RGS14 inhibits Raf binding, indicating that Gialpha1 and Raf binding to RGS14 are mutually exclusive. Taken together, these findings indicate that RGS14 is a newly appreciated integrator of G protein and Ras/Raf signalling pathways.},

To understand the mechanism by which phosphorylation inactivates isocitrate dehydrogenase, the sequence of icd, the isocitrate dehydrogenase structural gene, was determined and this information was used to construct mutants at the site of phosphorylation. Introduction of a negatively charged aspartate for the serine that is phosphorylated completely inactivates isocitrate dehydrogenase. Substitution of the serine with other amino acids results in a partially active enzyme in which both maximal velocity and interaction with substrates has been altered. Neither threonine nor tyrosine, when substituted for the serine at the phosphorylation site, is detectably phosphorylated by isocitrate dehydrogenase kinase.},

abstract = {The dynamic process of differentiation depends on the architecture, quantitative parameters, and noise of underlying genetic circuits. However, it remains unclear how these elements combine to control cellular behavior. We analyzed the probabilistic and transient differentiation of Bacillus subtilis cells into the state of competence. A few key parameters independently tuned the frequency of initiation and the duration of competence episodes and allowed the circuit to access different dynamic regimes, including oscillation. Altering circuit architecture showed that the duration of competence events can be made more precise. We used an experimental method to reduce global cellular noise and showed that noise levels are correlated with frequency of differentiation events. Together, the data reveal a noise-dependent circuit that is remarkably resilient and tunable in terms of its dynamic behavior.},

abstract = {Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) is a potent chemoattractant that is primarily involved in inflammation, immune responses and host defence against infection. LTB4 activates inflammatory cells by binding to its cell-surface receptor (BLTR). LTB4 can also bind and activate the intranudear transcription factor PPAR alpha, resulting in the activation of genes that terminate inflammatory processes. Here we report the cloning of the complementary DNA encoding a cell-surface LTB4 receptor that is highly expressed in human leukocytes. Using a subtraction strategy, we isolated two cDNA clones (HL-1 and HL-5) from retinoic acid-differentiated HL-60 cells. These two clones contain identical open reading frames encoding a protein of 352 amino acids and predicted to contain seven membrane-spanning domains, but different 5'-untranslated regions. Membrane fractions of Cos-7 cells transfected with an expression construct containing the open reading frame of HL-5 showed specific LTB4 binding, with a K(d) (0.154nM) comparable to that observed in retinoic acid-differentiated HL-60 cells. In CHO cells stably expressing this receptor, LTB4 induced increases in intracellular calcium, D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) accumulation, and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Furthermore, CHO cells expressing exogenous BLTR showed marked chemotactic responses towards low concentrations of LTB4 in a pertussis-toxin-sensitive manner. Our findings, together with previous reports, show that LTB4 is a unique lipid mediator that interacts with both cell-surface and nuclear receptors.},

abstract = {The kinetics of Ras activation by Son of sevenless (SOS) changes profoundly when Ras is tethered to membranes, instead of being in solution. SOS has two binding sites for Ras, one of which is an allosteric site that is distal to the active site. The activity of the SOS catalytic unit (SOS(cat)) is up to 500-fold higher when Ras is on membranes compared to rates in solution, because the allosteric Ras site anchors SOS(cat) to the membrane. This effect is blocked by the N-terminal segment of SOS, which occludes the allosteric site. We show that SOS responds to the membrane density of Ras molecules, to their state of GTP loading and to the membrane concentration of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), and that the integration of these signals potentiates the release of autoinhibition.},

abstract = {Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression, or noise, is a general phenomenon observed within cell populations. Transcription is known to be the key stage of gene expression where noise is generated, however, how variation in RNA polymerase (RNAP) concentration contributes to gene expression noise is unclear. Here, we quantitatively investigate how variations in absolute amounts of RNAP molecules affect noise in the expression of two fluorescent protein reporters driven by identical promoters. We find that intrinsic noise is independent of variation in RNAP concentrations, whereas extrinsic noise, which is variation in gene expression due to varying cellular environments, scales linearly with variation in RNAP abundance. Specifically, the propagation of RNAP abundance variation to expressed protein noise is inversely proportional to the concentration of RNAP, which suggests that the change in noise that results from RNAP fluctuations is determined by the fraction of promoters that is not occupied by RNAP.},

We identified multiple, cis-acting regions that recruit the Caenorhabditis elegans dosage compensation complex (DCC) through a search for regions of X that bind the complex when detached from X. The DCC normally assembles along the entire X chromosome, but not all detached regions recruit the complex, despite having genes known to be dosage compensated on the native X. Thus, the DCC binds first to recruitment sites, then spreads to neighboring X regions to accomplish chromosome-wide gene repression. From a large chromosomal domain, we defined a 793-base pair fragment that functions in vivo as an X-recognition element to recruit the DCC.},

To dissect accurately the role of each complex in mitosis, we have made and studied the first vertebrate conditional knockouts of the genes encoding condensin I subunit CAP-H and condensin II subunit CAP-D3 in chicken DT40 cells. Live-cell imaging reveals highly distinct segregation defects. CAP-D3 (condensin II) knockout results in masses of chromatin-containing anaphase bridges. CAP-H (condensin I)-knockout anaphases have a more subtle defect, with chromatids showing fine chromatin fibres that are associated with failure of cytokinesis and cell death. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that condensin-I-depleted mitotic chromosomes are wider and shorter, with a diffuse chromosome scaffold, whereas condensin-II-depleted chromosomes retain a more defined scaffold, with chromosomes more stretched and seemingly lacking in axial rigidity. We conclude that condensin II is required primarily to provide rigidity by establishing an initial chromosome axis around which condensin I can arrange loops of chromatin.},

abstract = {Peptide identification using tandem mass spectrometry is a core technology in proteomics. Latest generations of mass spectrometry instruments enable the use of electron transfer dissociation (ETD) to complement collision induced dissociation (CID) for peptide fragmentation. However, a critical limitation to the use of ETD has been optimal database search software. Percolator is a post-search algorithm, which uses semi-supervised machine learning to improve the rate of peptide spectrum identifications (PSMs) together with providing reliable significance measures. We have previously interfaced the Mascot search engine with Percolator and demonstrated sensitivity and specificity benefits with CID data. Here, we report recent developments in the Mascot Percolator V2.0 software including an improved feature calculator and support for a wider range of ion series. The updated software is applied to the analysis of several CID and ETD fragmented peptide data sets. This version of Mascot Percolator increases the number of CID PSMs by up to 80{\%} and ETD PSMs by up to 60{\%} at a 0.01 q-value (1{\%} false discovery rate) threshold over a standard Mascot search, notably recovering PSMs from high charge state precursor ions. The greatly increased number of PSMs and peptide coverage afforded by Mascot Percolator has enabled a fuller assessment of CID/ETD complementarity to be performed. Using a data set of CID and ETcaD spectral pairs, we find that at a 1{\%} false discovery rate, the overlap in peptide identifications by CID and ETD is 83{\%}, which is significantly higher than that obtained using either stand-alone Mascot (69{\%}) or OMSSA (39{\%}). We conclude that Mascot Percolator is a highly sensitive and accurate post-search algorithm for peptide identification and allows direct comparison of peptide identifications using multiple alternative fragmentation techniques.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Beneficial mutations play an essential role in bacterial adaptation, yet little is known about their fitness effects across genetic backgrounds and environments. One prominent example of bacterial adaptation is antibiotic resistance. Until recently, the paradigm has been that antibiotic resistance is selected by the presence of antibiotics because resistant mutations confer fitness costs in antibiotic free environments. In this study we show that it is not always the case, documenting the selection and fixation of resistant mutations in populations of Escherichia coli B that had never been exposed to antibiotics but instead evolved for 2000 generations at high temperature (42.2Â°C).

RESULTS: We found parallel mutations within the rpoB gene encoding the beta subunit of RNA polymerase. These amino acid substitutions conferred different levels of rifampicin resistance. The resistant mutations typically appeared, and were fixed, early in the evolution experiment. We confirmed the high advantage of these mutations at 42.2Â°C in glucose-limited medium. However, the rpoB mutations had different fitness effects across three genetic backgrounds and six environments.

CONCLUSIONS: We describe resistance mutations that are not necessarily costly in the absence of antibiotics or compensatory mutations but are highly beneficial at high temperature and low glucose. Their fitness effects depend on the environment and the genetic background, providing glimpses into the prevalence of epistasis and pleiotropy.},

abstract = {Stress-induced eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) alpha phosphorylation paradoxically increases translation of the metazoan activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), activating the integrated stress response (ISR), a pro-survival gene expression program. Previous studies implicated the 5' end of the ATF4 mRNA, with its two conserved upstream ORFs (uORFs), in this translational regulation. Here, we report on mutation analysis of the ATF4 mRNA which revealed that scanning ribosomes initiate translation efficiently at both uORFs and ribosomes that had translated uORF1 efficiently reinitiate translation at downstream AUGs. In unstressed cells, low levels of eIF2alpha phosphorylation favor early capacitation of such reinitiating ribosomes directing them to the inhibitory uORF2, which precludes subsequent translation of ATF4 and represses the ISR. In stressed cells high levels of eIF2alpha phosphorylation delays ribosome capacitation and favors reinitiation at ATF4 over the inhibitory uORF2. These features are common to regulated translation of GCN4 in yeast. The metazoan ISR thus resembles the yeast general control response both in its target genes and its mechanistic details.},

abstract = {Recent studies have generated interest in the use of the homologous recombination system of bacteriophage ?? for genetic engineering. The system, called Red, consists primarily of three proteins: ?? exonuclease, which processively digests the 5???-ended strand of a dsDNA end; ?? protein, which binds to ssDNA and promotes strand annealing; and ?? protein, which binds to the bacterial RecBCD enzyme and inhibits its activities. These proteins induce a 'hyper-rec' state in Escherichia coli and other bacteria, in which recombination events between DNA species with as little as 40 bp of shared sequence occur at high frequency. Red-mediated recombination in the hyper-rec bacterium proceeds via a number of different pathways, and with the involvement of different sets of bacterial proteins, depending in part on the nature of the recombining DNA species. The role of high-frequency double-strand break repair/recombination in the life cycle of the lambdoid phages is discussed. ?? 2001 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.},

abstract = {The glyoxylate bypass allows Escherichia coli to grow on carbon sources with only two carbons by bypassing the loss of carbons as CO(2) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The flux toward this bypass is regulated by the phosphorylation of the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) by a bifunctional kinase-phosphatase called IDHKP. In this system, IDH activity has been found to be remarkably robust with respect to wide variations in the total IDH protein concentration. Here, we examine possible mechanisms to explain this robustness. Explanations in which IDHKP works simultaneously as a first-order kinase and as a zero-order phosphatase with a single IDH binding site are found to be inconsistent with robustness. Instead, we suggest a robust mechanism where both substrates bind the bifunctional enzyme to form a ternary complex.},

Such heterogeneity can be essential for many biological processes and is conjectured to arise from stochasticity, or noise, in gene expression. We constructed strains of Escherichia coli that enable detection of noise and discrimination between the two mechanisms by which it is generated. Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

ER can sense the stress and respond to it through translational attenuation, upregulation of the genes for ER chaperones and related proteins, and degradation of unfolded proteins by a quality-control system. However, when the ER function is severely impaired, the organelle elicits apoptotic signals. ER stress has been implicated in a variety of common diseases such as diabetes, ischemia and neurodegenerative disorders. One of the components of the ER stress-mediated apoptosis pathway is C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), also known as growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153). Here, we summarize the current understanding of the roles of CHOP/GADD153 in ER stress-mediated apoptosis and in diseases including diabetes, brain ischemia and neurodegenerative disease.},

@article{Siso-Nadal2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: To control and manipulate cellular signaling, we need to understand cellular strategies for information transfer, integration, and decision-making. A key feature of signal transduction is the generation of only a few intracellular messengers by many extracellular stimuli.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we model molecular cross-talk between two classic second messengers, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and calcium, and show that the dynamical complexity of the response of both messengers increases substantially through their interaction. In our model of a non-excitable cell, both cAMP and calcium concentrations can oscillate. If mutually inhibitory, cross-talk between the two second messengers can increase the range of agonist concentrations for which oscillations occur. If mutually activating, cross-talk decreases the oscillation range, but can generate 'bursting' oscillations of calcium and may enable better filtering of noise.

CONCLUSION: We postulate that this increased dynamical complexity allows the cell to encode more information, particularly if both second messengers encode signals. In their native environments, it is unlikely that cells are exposed to one stimulus at a time, and cross-talk may help generate sufficiently complex responses to allow the cell to discriminate between different combinations and concentrations of extracellular agonists.},

abstract = {Loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene xol-1 cause the feminization and death of XO animals (normally males) by shifting the sex determination and dosage compensation pathways toward their hermaphrodite modes. XO-specific lethality most likely results from the reduction in X chromosome expression caused by xol-1 mutations. Mutations in genes required for the hermaphrodite mode of dosage compensation suppress lethality but not feminization, and restore X chromosome expression to nearly wild-type levels. Mutations in genes that control the hermaphrodite modes of both sex determination and dosage compensation fully suppress both defects. These interactions suggest that xol-1 is the earliest-acting gene in the known hierarchy controlling the male/hermaphrodite decision and is perhaps the gene nearest the primary sex-determining signal. We propose that the wild-type xol-1 gene product promotes male development by ensuring that genes (or gene products) directing hermaphrodite sex determination and dosage compensation are inactive in XO animals. Interestingly, in addition to feminizing XO animals, xol-1 mutations further masculinize XX animals already partially masculinized.},

Here we present a simple and efficient method for examining the de novo kinetics. GFP with an immature chromophore was synthesized in a reconstituted cell-free protein synthesis system under anaerobic conditions. Chromophore maturation was initiated by rapid dilution in an air-saturated maturation buffer, and the time course of fluorescence development was monitored. Comparison of the de novo maturation rates in various GFP variants revealed that some folding mutations near the chromophore promoted rapid chromophore maturation and that the accumulation of mutations could reduce the maturation rate. Our method will contribute to the design of rapidly maturing fluorescent proteins with improved characteristics for real-time monitoring of cellular events.},

Surprisingly, we identified here dimerization of membrane anchored Ras by combining attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, biomolecular simulations, and F{\"{o}}rster resonance energy transfer experiments. By analyzing x-ray structural models and molecular-dynamics simulations, we propose a dimerization interface between $\alpha$-helices 4 and 5 and the loop between $\beta$2 and $\beta$3. This seems to explain why the residues D47, E49, R135, R161, and R164 of this interface are influencing Ras signaling in cellular physiological experiments, although they are not positioned in the catalytic site. Dimerization could catalyze nanoclustering, which is well accepted for membrane-bound Ras. The interface could provide a new target for a seemingly novel type of small molecule interfering with signal transduction in oncogenic Ras mutants.},

Here we report a large-scale inactivation of the expressed genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. For this purpose, we have established a high-throughput "RNAi-by-soaking" methodology by modifying the conventional RNAi method [1, 2]. A set of tag-sequenced, nonredundant cDNAs corresponding to approximately 10,000 genes [3] (representing half of the predicted genes [4]) was used for the systematic RNAi analysis. We have processed approximately 2500 genes to date. In development, 27{\%} of them showed detectable phenotypes, such as embryonic lethality, post-embryonic lethality, sterility, and morphological abnormality. Of these, we analyzed the phenotypes of F1 sterility in detail, and we have identified 24 genes that might play important roles in germline development. Combined with the ongoing analysis of expression patterns of these cDNAs [3, 5], the functional information obtained in this work will provide a starting point for the further analysis of each gene. Another finding from this screening is that the incidence of essential genes is significantly lower in the X chromosome than in the autosomes.},

abstract = {Central functions in the cell are often linked to complex dynamic behaviours, such as sustained oscillations and multistability, in a biochemical reaction network. Determination of the specific mechanisms underlying such behaviours is important, e.g. to determine sensitivity, robustness, and modelling requirements of given cell functions. In this work we adopt a systems approach to the analysis of complex behaviours in intracellular reaction networks, described by ordinary differential equations with known kinetic parameters. We propose to decompose the overall system into a number of low complexity subsystems, and consider the importance of interactions between these in generating specific behaviours. Rather than analysing the network in a state corresponding to the complex non-linear behaviour, we move the system to the underlying unstable steady state, and focus on the mechanisms causing destabilisation of this steady state. This is motivated by the fact that all complex behaviours in unforced systems can be traced to destabilisation (bifurcation) of some steady state, and hence enables us to use tools from linear system theory to qualitatively analyse the sources of given network behaviours. One important objective of the present study is to see how far one can come with a relatively simple approach to the analysis of highly complex biochemical networks. The proposed method is demonstrated by application to a model of mitotic control in Xenopus frog eggs, and to a model of circadian oscillations in Drosophila. In both examples we are able to identify the subsystems, and the related interactions, which are instrumental in generating the observed complex non-linear behaviours.},

Such a strategy is extremely powerful, albeit not adequate in the analysis of unpredicted postgenome events, such as posttranslational modifications, which exponentially increase the search space. Therefore, it is of interest to explore "database-free" approaches. Here, we sampled the ostrich and human proteomes with a method facilitating de novo sequencing, utilizing the protease Lys-N in combination with electron transfer dissociation. By implementing several validation steps, including the combined use of collision-induced dissociation/electron transfer dissociation data and a cross-validation with conventional database search strategies, we identified approximately 2,500 unique de novo peptide sequences from the ostrich sample with over 900 peptides generating full backbone sequence coverage. This dataset allowed the appropriate positioning of ostrich in the evolutionary tree. The described database-free sequencing approach is generically applicable and has great potential in important proteomics applications such as in the analysis of variable parts of endogenous antibodies or proteins modified by a plethora of complex posttranslational modifications.},

abstract = {Localization of signaling complexes to specific microdomains coordinates signal transduction at the plasma membrane. Using immunogold electron microscopy of plasma membrane sheets coupled with spatial point pattern analysis, we have visualized morphologically featureless microdomains, including lipid rafts, in situ and at high resolution. We find that an inner-plasma membrane lipid raft marker displays cholesterol-dependent clustering in microdomains with a mean diameter of 44 nm that occupy 35{\%} of the cell surface. Cross-linking an outer-leaflet raft protein results in the redistribution of inner leaflet rafts, but they retain their modular structure. Analysis of Ras microlocalization shows that inactive H-ras is distributed between lipid rafts and a cholesterol-independent microdomain. Conversely, activated H-ras and K-ras reside predominantly in nonoverlapping, cholesterol-independent microdomains. Galectin-1 stabilizes the association of activated H-ras with these nonraft microdomains, whereas K-ras clustering is supported by farnesylation, but not geranylgeranylation. These results illustrate that the inner plasma membrane comprises a complex mosaic of discrete microdomains. Differential spatial localization within this framework can likely account for the distinct signal outputs from the highly homologous Ras proteins.},

abstract = {Bacteria have developed mechanisms to communicate and compete with one another in diverse environments. A new form of intercellular communication, contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI), was discovered recently in Escherichia coli. CDI is mediated by the CdiB/CdiA two-partner secretion (TPS) system. CdiB facilitates secretion of the CdiA 'exoprotein' onto the cell surface. An additional small immunity protein (CdiI) protects CDI(+) cells from autoinhibition. The mechanisms by which CDI blocks cell growth and by which CdiI counteracts this growth arrest are unknown. Moreover, the existence of CDI activity in other bacteria has not been explored. Here we show that the CDI growth inhibitory activity resides within the carboxy-terminal region of CdiA (CdiA-CT), and that CdiI binds and inactivates cognate CdiA-CT, but not heterologous CdiA-CT. Bioinformatic and experimental analyses show that multiple bacterial species encode functional CDI systems with high sequence variability in the CdiA-CT and CdiI coding regions. CdiA-CT heterogeneity implies that a range of toxic activities are used during CDI. Indeed, CdiA-CTs from uropathogenic E. coli and the plant pathogen Dickeya dadantii have different nuclease activities, each providing a distinct mechanism of growth inhibition. Finally, we show that bacteria lacking the CdiA-CT and CdiI coding regions are unable to compete with isogenic wild-type CDI(+) cells both in laboratory media and on a eukaryotic host. Taken together, these results suggest that CDI systems constitute an intricate immunity network with an important function in bacterial competition.},

abstract = {The cellular stress response is a universal mechanism of extraordinary physiological/pathophysiological significance. It represents a defense reaction of cells to damage that environmental forces inflict on macromolecules. Many aspects of the cellular stress response are not stressor specific because cells monitor stress based on macromolecular damage without regard to the type of stress that causes such damage. Cellular mechanisms activated by DNA damage and protein damage are interconnected and share common elements. Other cellular responses directed at re-establishing homeostasis are stressor specific and often activated in parallel to the cellular stress response. All organisms have stress proteins, and universally conserved stress proteins can be regarded as the minimal stress proteome. Functional analysis of the minimal stress proteome yields information about key aspects of the cellular stress response, including physiological mechanisms of sensing membrane lipid, protein, and DNA damage; redox sensing and regulation; cell cycle control; macromolecular stabilization/repair; and control of energy metabolism. In addition, cells can quantify stress and activate a death program (apoptosis) when tolerance limits are exceeded.},

Such networks then respond ultrasensitively in a nonlinear manner to linear changes in network input, and network output, for example, levels of a phosphorylated protein or of gene expression, becomes a sigmoidal function of concentrations of input molecules. We present a novel, entropic ultrasensitivity mechanism that generates highly cooperative and specific binding between two proteins. We consider a disordered protein with multiple phosphorylation sites that binds to a single binding site on an interacting protein. We assume that each phosphorylation locally orders the protein. Such local order affects protein conformational entropy nonlinearly and generates binding that is a highly cooperative function of the number of protein phosphorylations (with Hill coefficients well above 10). Substantial binding may only occur once the disordered protein is phosphorylated a critical number of times or more. Cooperativity is determined by the size of the disordered region of the protein, the binding affinity, and unusually the concentration of the interacting protein. Given the widespread occurrence of disordered, multiply phosphorylated proteins, its highly ultrasensitive character, and the ease of its control, entropic, phosphorylation-driven cooperativity may be extensively exploited intracellularly.},

Importantly, (iv) the current size is not the only variable controlling cell division, but the time spent in the cell cycle appears to play a role, and (v) common tests of cell size control may fail when such concerted control is in place.

The basic underlying mechanism of action of these complexes remained enigmatic. Direct visualization of condensin and cohesin was expected to provide hints to their mechanisms. They are composed of heterodimers of distinct structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) proteins and other non-SMC subunits. Here, we report the first observation of the architecture of condensin and its interaction with DNA by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The purified condensin SMC heterodimer shows a head-tail structure with a single head composed of globular domains and a tail with the coiled-coil region. Unexpectedly, the condensin non-SMC trimers associate with the head of SMC heterodimers, producing a larger head with the tail. The heteropentamer is bound to DNA in a distributive fashion, whereas condensin SMC heterodimers interact with DNA as aggregates within a large DNA-protein assembly. Thus, non-SMC trimers may regulate the ATPase activity of condensin by directly interacting with the globular domains of SMC heterodimer and alter the mode of DNA interaction. A model for the action of heteropentamer is presented.},

Here, we show that the CdiA-CT from uropathogenic Escherichia coli strain 536 (UPEC536) is a latent tRNase that requires activation by the biosynthetic enzyme CysK (O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase A). UPEC536 CdiA-CT exhibits no nuclease activity in vitro, but cleaves within transfer RNA (tRNA) anti-codon loops when purified CysK is added. CysK and CdiA-CT form a stable complex, and their binding interaction appears to mimic that of the CysK/CysE cysteine synthase complex. CdiA-CT activation is also required for growth inhibition. Synthesis of CdiA-CT in E. coli cysK(+) cells arrests cell growth, whereas the growth of $\Delta$cysK mutants is unaffected by the toxin. Moreover, E. coli $\Delta$cysK cells are completely resistant to inhibitor cells expressing UPEC536 CdiA, indicating that CysK is required to activate the tRNase during CDI. Thus, CysK acts as a permissive factor for CDI, providing a potential mechanism to modulate growth inhibition in target cells.},

Although it has been clear for many years that nucleosomes constitute the first level of chromatin compaction, this contributes a relatively small fraction of the condensation needed to fit the typical genome into an interphase nucleus or set of metaphase chromosomes, indicating that there are additional "higher order" levels of chromatin condensation. Identifying these levels, their interrelationships, and the principles that govern their occurrence has been a challenging and much discussed problem. In this article, we focus on recent experimental advances and the emerging evidence indicating that structural plasticity and chromatin dynamics play dominant roles in genome organization.

abstract = {Myxobacteria provide one of the simplest models of cell-cell interaction and organized cell movement leading to cellular differentiation. When starved, tens of thousands of cells change their movement pattern from outward spreading to inward concentration; they form aggregates that become fruiting bodies. Cells inside fruiting bodies differentiate into round, nonmotile, environmentally resistant spores. Traditionally, cell aggregation has been considered to imply chemotaxis; a long-range cell interaction. However, myxobacterial aggregation is the consequence of direct cell-contact interactions, not chemotaxis. We present here a 3D stochastic lattice-gas cellular automata model of cell aggregation based on local cell-cell contact, and no chemotaxis. We demonstrate that a 3D discrete stochastic model can simulate two stages of cell aggregation. First, a "traffic jam" forms embedded in a field of motile cells. The jam then becomes an aggregation center that accumulates more cells. We show that, at high cell density, cells stream around the traffic jam, generating a 3D hemispherical mound. Later, when the nuclear traffic jam dissolves, the aggregation center becomes a 3D ring of streaming cells.},

We find that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans approximately 2,000 transcripts undergo expression oscillations synchronized with larval transitions while thousands of genes are expressed in temporal gradients, similar to known timing regulators. By counting transcripts in individual worms, we show that pulsatile expression of the microRNA (miRNA) lin-4 maintains the temporal gradient of its target lin-14 by dampening its expression oscillations. Our results demonstrate that this insulation is optimal when pulsatile expression of the miRNA and its target is synchronous. We propose that such a miRNA-mediated incoherent feed-forward loop is a potent filter that prevents the propagation of potentially deleterious fluctuations in gene expression during the development of an organism.},

We verified model predictions by measuring time courses of several extra- and intracellular components such as glycolytic intermediates, EII-ACrr phosphorylation level, both LacZ and PtsG concentrations, and total cAMP concentrations under various growth conditions. The entire data base consists of 18 experiments performed with nine different strains. The model describes the expression of 17 key enzymes, 38 enzymatic reactions, and the dynamic behavior of more than 50 metabolites. The different phenomena affecting the phosphorylation level of EIIACrr, the key regulation molecule for inducer exclusion and catabolite repression in enteric bacteria, can now be explained quantitatively.},

abstract = {This article introduces the finite state projection (FSP) method for use in the stochastic analysis of chemically reacting systems. One can describe the chemical populations of such systems with probability density vectors that evolve according to a set of linear ordinary differential equations known as the chemical master equation (CME). Unlike Monte Carlo methods such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) or tau leaping, the FSP directly solves or approximates the solution of the CME. If the CME describes a system that has a finite number of distinct population vectors, the FSP method provides an exact analytical solution. When an infinite or extremely large number of population variations is possible, the state space can be truncated, and the FSP method provides a certificate of accuracy for how closely the truncated space approximation matches the true solution. The proposed FSP algorithm systematically increases the projection space in order to meet prespecified tolerance in the total probability density error. For any system in which a sufficiently accurate FSP exists, the FSP algorithm is shown to converge in a finite number of steps. The FSP is utilized to solve two examples taken from the field of systems biology, and comparisons are made between the FSP, the SSA, and tau leaping algorithms. In both examples, the FSP outperforms the SSA in terms of accuracy as well as computational efficiency. Furthermore, due to very small molecular counts in these particular examples, the FSP also performs far more effectively than tau leaping methods.},

abstract = {The RTK-Ras-ERK cascade is a central signaling module implicated in the control of diverse biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The coupling of RTK to Ras is mediated by the Ras-specific nucleotide-exchange factor Son of Sevenless (Sos), which activates Ras by inducing the exchange of GDP for GTP . Considerable evidence indicates that the duration and amplitude of Ras signals are important determinants in controlling the biological outcome . However, the mechanisms that regulate the quantitative output of Ras signaling remain poorly understood. We define a previously unrecognized regulatory component of the machinery that specifies the kinetic properties of signals propagated through the RTK-Ras-ERK cascade. We demonstrate that the establishment of a positive feedback loop involving Ras.GTP and Sos leads to an increase in the amplitude and duration of Ras activation in response to EGF stimulation. This effect is propagated to downstream elements of the pathway as reflected by sustained EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation and enhanced SRE-dependent transcription. As a consequence, the physiological endpoint of EGF action is switched from proliferation to differentiation. We propose that the engagement of Ras/Sos positive feedback loop may contribute to the mechanism by which ligand stimulation is coupled to discrete biological responses.},

@article{Meyer2005,
abstract = {In mammals, flies, and worms, sex is determined by distinctive regulatory mechanisms that cause males (XO or XY) and females (XX) to differ in their dose of X chromosomes. In each species, an essential X chromosome-wide process called dosage compensation ensures that somatic cells of either sex express equal levels of X-linked gene products. The strategies used to achieve dosage compensation are diverse, but in all cases, specialized complexes are targeted specifically to the X chromosome(s) of only one sex to regulate transcript levels. In C. elegans, this sex-specific targeting of the dosage compensation complex (DCC) is controlled by the same developmental signal that establishes sex, the ratio of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes (X:A signal). Molecular components of this chromosome counting process have been defined. Following a common step of regulation, sex determination and dosage compensation are controlled by distinct genetic pathways. C. elegans dosage compensation is implemented by a protein complex that binds both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites to reduce transcript levels by one-half. The dosage compensation complex resembles the conserved 13S condensin complex required for both mitotic and meiotic chromosome resolution and condensation, implying the recruitment of ancient proteins to the new task of regulating gene expression. Within each C. elegans somatic cell, one of the DCC components also participates in the separate mitotic/meiotic condensin complex. Other DCC components play pivotal roles in regulating the number and distribution of crossovers during meiosis. The strategy by which C. elegans X chromosomes attract the condensin-like DCC is known. Small, well-dispersed X-recognition elements act as entry sites to recruit the dosage compensation complex and to nucleate spreading of the complex to X regions that lack recruitment sites. In this manner, a repressed chromatin state is spread in cis over short or long distances, thus establishing the global, epigenetic regulation of X chromosomes that is maintained throughout the lifetime of hermaphrodites.},

In yeast, it is unclear how this regulation achieves the required equimolar amounts of the different RP components, given that some RP genes exist in duplicate copies, while others have only one copy. Here, we tested whether the solution to this challenge is partly encoded within the DNA sequence of the RP promoters, by fusing 110 different RP promoters to a fluorescent gene reporter, allowing us to robustly detect differences in their promoter activities that are as small as {\~{}}10{\%}. We found that single-copy RP promoters have significantly higher activities, suggesting that proper RP stoichiometry is indeed partly encoded within the RP promoters. Notably, we also partially uncovered how this regulation is encoded by finding that RP promoters with higher activity have more nucleosome-disfavoring sequences and characteristic spatial organizations of these sequences and of binding sites for key RP regulators. Mutations in these elements result in a significant decrease of RP promoter activity. Thus, our results suggest that intrinsic (DNA-dependent) nucleosome organization may be a key mechanism by which genomes encode biologically meaningful promoter activities. Our approach can readily be applied to uncover how transcriptional programs of other promoters are encoded.},

We show that resistance expression and drug inhibition are linked in a positive feedback loop arising from an innate, global effect of drug-inhibited growth on gene expression. A quantitative model of bacterial growth based on this innate feedback accurately predicts the rich phenomena observed: a plateau-shaped fitness landscape, with an abrupt drop in the growth rates of cultures at a threshold drug concentration, and the coexistence of growing and nongrowing populations, that is, growth bistability, below the threshold.},

To study this process, we have used deletion-insertions to disrupt sequentially from one to four of the seven rRNA (rrn) operons on the Escherichia coli genome. Inactivation of four rrn operons caused a 2.3-fold increase in the expression of a chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter gene fused to the tandem promoters of rrnA and a similar increase in the expression of the trp tRNA gene at the end of rrnC. This reflected enhanced expression of the remaining operons to compensate for having only three intact copies. The elevated expression was caused by an increase in both transcription initiation and RNA polymerase elongation rates specifically on rrn operons and occurred in the absence of changes in the intracellular concentration of ppGpp, suggesting that ppGpp is not involved in the regulation of this phenomenon. We discuss these results in relation to the ribosome feedback inhibition model described by Nomura and coworkers.},

We studied a CRP variant (CRP(cl)), in which the subunits are crosslinked. We demonstrate that CRP(cl) can activate transcription even in the absence of cAMP. Implications of these results for the crystallographically-determined structure of cAMP-CRP are discussed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous applications of fluorescence microscopy require quantitation of signal intensity in reproducible units. Two problems must be overcome to achieve this goal. First, due to various instrumental factors, the same sample imaged on two microscopes or even on the same microscope at different times may produce highly divergent readings. Second, because of shading, some areas within the same field may appear brighter than others despite the same amount of fluorophore. The first type of variability requires calibration using a sample of reproducible fluorescence yield; to correct for shading, a uniform fluorescent field is needed. METHODS: Standard slides were prepared by placing several microliters of 10{\%}-50{\%} w/v fluorescein or rhodamine between a coverglass and a slide. They were used to perform shading correction and normalization under a variety of imaging conditions. RESULTS: Concentrated fluorophores produced a uniform fluorescent field of moderate and reproducible brightness. By expressing the staining of a biological object in the units of standard slides, identical results were obtained irrespective of the imaging conditions or the microscope used. We compared shading correction based on concentrated fluorescein with two other standards. Concentrated fluorescein resulted in the best equalization of the field. CONCLUSIONS: Standardization of fluorescent images can be achieved by normalizing them to the image of a concentrated solution of a fluorophore. Due to its simplicity and efficiency, this method can be used in clinical analysis as well as in routine laboratory practice.},

abstract = {Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F26P2) was identified as a regulator of glucose metabolism over 25 years ago. A truly bifunctional enzyme, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (6PFK2/FBP2), with two active sites synthesizes F26P2 from fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) and ATP or degrades F26P2 to F6P and Pi. In the classic view, F26P2 regulates glucose metabolism by allosteric effects on 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (6PFK1, activation) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase, inhibition). When levels of F26P2 are high, glycolysis is enhanced and gluconeogenesis is inhibited. In this regard, altering levels of F26P2 via 6PFK2/FBP2 overexpression has been used for metabolic modulation, and has been shown capable of restoring euglycemia in rodent models of diabetes. Recently, a number of novel observations have suggested that F26P2 has much broader effects on the enzymes of glucose metabolism. This is evidenced by the effects of F26P2 on the gene expression of two key glucose metabolic enzymes, glucokinase (GK) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase). When levels of F26P2 are elevated in the liver, the gene expression and protein amount of GK is increased whereas G6Pase is decreased. These coordinated changes in GK and G6Pase protein illustrate how F26P2 regulates glucose metabolism. F26P2 also affects the gene expression of enzymes related to lipid metabolism. When F26P2 levels are elevated in liver, the expression of two key lipogenic enzymes, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) is reduced, contributing to a unique coordinated decrease in lipogenesis. When combined, F26P2 effects on glucose and lipid metabolism provide cooperative regulation of fuel metabolism. The regulatory roles for F26P2 have also expanded to transcription factors, as well as certain key proteins (enzymes) of signaling and/or energy sensoring. Although some effects may be secondary to changes in metabolite levels, high levels of F26P2 have been shown to regulate protein amount and/or phosphorylation state of hepatic nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1alpha), carbohydrate response element binding protein (ChREBP), peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1beta (PGC1beta), as well as Akt and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Importantly, changes in these transcription factors, signaling proteins, and sensor proteins are produced in a way that appropriately coordinates whole body fuel metabolism.},

abstract = {Anapleurosis is the filling of the tricarboxylic acid cycle with four-carbon units. The common substrate for both anapleurosis and glucose phosphorylation in bacteria is the terminal glycolytic metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). Here we show that Escherichia coli quickly and almost completely turns off PEP consumption upon glucose removal. The resulting buildup of PEP is used to quickly import glucose if it becomes available again. The switch-like termination of anapleurosis results from depletion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), an ultrasensitive allosteric activator of PEP carboxylase. E. coli expressing an FBP-insensitive point mutant of PEP carboxylase grow normally when glucose is steadily available. However, they fail to build up PEP upon glucose removal, grow poorly when glucose availability oscillates and suffer from futile cycling at the PEP node on gluconeogenic substrates. Thus, bacterial central carbon metabolism is intrinsically programmed with ultrasensitive allosteric regulation to enable rapid adaptation to changing environmental conditions.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that the metabolism of some organisms, such as Escherichia coli, is remarkably efficient, producing close to the maximum amount of biomass per unit of nutrient consumed. This observation raises the question of what regulatory mechanisms enable such efficiency. Here, we propose that simple product-feedback inhibition by itself is capable of leading to such optimality. We analyze several representative metabolic modules--starting from a linear pathway and advancing to a bidirectional pathway and metabolic cycle, and finally to integration of two different nutrient inputs. In each case, our mathematical analysis shows that product-feedback inhibition is not only homeostatic but also, with appropriate feedback connections, can minimize futile cycling and optimize fluxes. However, the effectiveness of simple product-feedback inhibition comes at the cost of high levels of some metabolite pools, potentially associated with toxicity and osmotic imbalance. These large metabolite pool sizes can be restricted if feedback inhibition is ultrasensitive. Indeed, the multi-layer regulation of metabolism by control of enzyme expression, enzyme covalent modification, and allostery is expected to result in such ultrasensitive feedbacks. To experimentally test whether the qualitative predictions from our analysis of feedback inhibition apply to metabolic modules beyond linear pathways, we examine the case of nitrogen assimilation in E. coli, which involves both nutrient integration and a metabolic cycle. We find that the feedback regulation scheme suggested by our mathematical analysis closely aligns with the actual regulation of the network and is sufficient to explain much of the dynamical behavior of relevant metabolite pool sizes in nutrient-switching experiments.},

abstract = {Fluoroquinolones are antibacterial drugs that inhibit DNA Gyrase and Topoisomerase IV. These essential enzymes facilitate chromosome replication and RNA transcription by regulating chromosome supercoiling. High-level resistance to fluoroquinolones in E. coli requires the accumulation of multiple mutations, including those that alter target genes and genes regulating drug efflux. Previous studies have shown some drug-resistance mutations reduce bacterial fitness, leading to the selection of fitness-compensatory mutations. The impact of fluoroquinolone-resistance on bacterial fitness was analyzed in constructed isogenic strains carrying up to 5 resistance mutations. Some mutations significantly decreased bacterial fitness both in vitro and in vivo. We identified low-fitness triple-mutants where the acquisition of a fourth resistance mutation significantly increased fitness in vitro and in vivo while at the same time dramatically decreasing drug susceptibility. The largest effect occurred with the addition of a parC mutation (Topoisomerase IV) to a low-fitness strain carrying resistance mutations in gyrA (DNA Gyrase) and marR (drug efflux regulation). Increased fitness was accompanied by a significant change in the level of gyrA promoter activity as measured in an assay of DNA supercoiling. In selection and competition experiments made in the absence of drug, parC mutants that improved fitness and reduced susceptibility were selected. These data suggest that natural selection for improved growth in bacteria with low-level resistance to fluoroquinolones could in some cases select for further reductions in drug susceptibility. Thus, increased resistance to fluoroquinolones could be selected even in the absence of further exposure to the drug.},

abstract = {The rates of consumption of different amino acids in protein synthesis are in general stoichiometrically coupled with coefficients determined by codon usage frequencies on translating ribosomes. We show that when the rates of synthesis of two or more amino acids are limiting for protein synthesis and exactly matching their coupled rates of consumption on translating ribosomes, the pools of aminoacyl-tRNAs in ternary complex with elongation factor Tu and GTP are hypersensitive to a variation in the rate of amino acid supply. This high sensitivity makes a macroscopic analysis inconclusive, because it is accompanied by almost free and anticorrelated diffusion in copy numbers of ternary complexes. This near-critical behavior is relevant for balanced growth of Escherichia coli cells in media that lack amino acids and for adaptation of E. coli cells after downshifts from amino-acid-containing to amino-acid-lacking growth media. The theoretical results are used to discuss transcriptional control of amino acid synthesis during multiple amino acid limitation, the recovery of E. coli cells after nutritional downshifts and to propose a robust mechanism for the regulation of RelA-dependent synthesis of the global effector molecule ppGpp.},

On activation, Ras diffusion was greatly suppressed/immobilized, suggesting the formation of large, activated Ras-signaling complexes. These complexes may work as platforms for transducing the Ras signal to effector molecules, further suggesting that Ras signal transduction requires more than simple collisions with effector molecules.

abstract = {The Ras-specific nucleotide exchange factor son of sevenless (SOS) is a large, multidomain protein with complex regulation, including a Ras-dependent allosteric mechanism. The N-terminal segment of SOS, the histone domain, contains two histone folds, which is highly unusual for a cytoplasmic protein. Using a combination of computational docking, small-angle x-ray scattering, mutagenesis, and calorimetry, we show that the histone domain folds into the rest of SOS and docks onto a helical linker that connects the pleckstrin-homology (PH) and Dbl-homology (DH) domains of SOS to the catalytic domain. In this model, a positively charged surface region on the histone domain is positioned so as to provide a fourth potential anchorage site on the membrane for SOS in addition to the PH domain, the allosteric Ras molecule, and the C-terminal adapter-binding site. The histone domain in SOS interacts with the helical linker, using a region of the surface that in nucleosomes is involved in histone tetramerization. Adjacent surface elements on the histone domain that correspond to the DNA-binding surface of nucleosomes form the predicted interaction site with the membrane. The orientation and position of the histone domain in the SOS model implicates it as a potential mediator of membrane-dependent activation signals.},

@article{Valentini2000,
abstract = {Pyruvate kinase (PK) is critical for the regulation of the glycolytic pathway. The regulatory properties of Escherichia coli were investigated by mutating six charged residues involved in interdomain salt bridges (Arg(271), Arg(292), Asp(297), and Lys(413)) and in the binding of the allosteric activator (Lys(382) and Arg(431)). Arg(271) and Lys(413) are located at the interface between A and C domains within one subunit. The R271L and K413Q mutant enzymes exhibit altered kinetic properties. In K413Q, there is partial enzyme activation, whereas R271L is characterized by a bias toward the T-state in the allosteric equilibrium. In the T-state, Arg(292) and Asp(297) form an intersubunit salt bridge. The mutants R292D and D297R are totally inactive. The crystal structure of R292D reveals that the mutant enzyme retains the T-state quaternary structure. However, the mutation induces a reorganization of the interface with the creation of a network of interactions similar to that observed in the crystal structures of R-state yeast and M1 PK proteins. Furthermore, in the R292D structure, two loops that are part of the active site are disordered. The K382Q and R431E mutations were designed to probe the binding site for fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate, the allosteric activator. R431E exhibits only slight changes in the regulatory properties. Conversely, K382Q displays a highly altered responsiveness to the activator, suggesting that Lys(382) is involved in both activator binding and allosteric transition mechanism. Taken together, these results support the notion that domain interfaces are critical for the allosteric transition. They couple changes in the tertiary and quaternary structures to alterations in the geometry of the fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate and substrate binding sites. These site-directed mutagenesis data are discussed in the light of the molecular basis for the hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, which is caused by mutations in human erythrocyte PK gene.},

However, direct observations of these rare switching events have so far been lacking, obscuring possible correlations between switching events themselves, and between switching and other cellular events, such as division and DNA replication. We monitored the phase variation of type 1 fimbriae in individual Escherichia coli in real time and simultaneously tracked the chromosome replication process. We observed distinctive patterns of fim (fimbriae) expression in multiple genealogically related lineages. These patterns could be explained by a model that combines a single switching event with chromosomal fim replication, as well as the epigenetic inheritance of expressed fim protein and RNA, and their dilution by growth. Analysis of the moment of switching at sub-cell-cycle resolution revealed a correlation between fim switching and cell age, which challenges the traditional idea of phase variation as a random Poissonian phenomenon.},

The resultant E. coli data set transforms our understanding of the extent to which protein synthesis is precisely controlled to optimize function and efficiency. Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. Our studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from quantitative analyses of protein synthesis.},

Most transcripts are non- coding RNAs (ncRNAs), which have various cellular functions. Small ncRNAs (or small RNAs) ncRNAs that are characteristically {\~{}}20-35 nucleotides long are required for the regulation of gene expression in many different organisms. Most small RNA species fall into one of the following three classes: microRNAs (miRNAs), short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009). Although different small RNA classes have different bio genesis pathways and exert different functions, all of them must associate with a member of the Argonaute protein family for activity. This article and its accompanying poster provide an overview of the different classes of small RNAs and the manner in which they interact with Argonaute protein family members during small-RNA-guided gene silencing. In addition, we highlight recently uncovered structural features of Argonaute proteins that shed light on their mechanism of action.},

abstract = {A major goal of biology is to provide a quantitative description of cellular behaviour. This task, however, has been hampered by the difficulty in measuring protein abundances and their variation. Here we present a strategy that pairs high-throughput flow cytometry and a library of GFP-tagged yeast strains to monitor rapidly and precisely protein levels at single-cell resolution. Bulk protein abundance measurements of {\textgreater}2,500 proteins in rich and minimal media provide a detailed view of the cellular response to these conditions, and capture many changes not observed by DNA microarray analyses. Our single-cell data argue that noise in protein expression is dominated by the stochastic production/destruction of messenger RNAs. Beyond this global trend, there are dramatic protein-specific differences in noise that are strongly correlated with a protein's mode of transcription and its function. For example, proteins that respond to environmental changes are noisy whereas those involved in protein synthesis are quiet. Thus, these studies reveal a remarkable structure to biological noise and suggest that protein noise levels have been selected to reflect the costs and potential benefits of this variation.},

Sequencing and computational technologies, however, have been a limiting factor in performing dense time series analysis of the human microbiome. Here, we present the largest human microbiota time series analysis to date, covering two individuals at four body sites over 396 timepoints.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We find that despite stable differences between body sites and individuals, there is pronounced variability in an individual's microbiota across months, weeks and even days. Additionally, only a small fraction of the total taxa found within a single body site appear to be present across all time points, suggesting that no core temporal microbiome exists at high abundance (although some microbes may be present but drop below the detection threshold). Many more taxa appear to be persistent but non-permanent community members.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: DNA sequencing and computational advances described here provide the ability to go beyond infrequent snapshots of our human-associated microbial ecology to high-resolution assessments of temporal variations over protracted periods, within and between body habitats and individuals. This capacity will allow us to define normal variation and pathologic states, and assess responses to therapeutic interventions.},

Lgr5 stem cells are interspersed between terminally differentiated Paneth cells that are known to produce bactericidal products such as lysozyme and cryptdins/defensins. Single Lgr5-expressing stem cells can be cultured to form long-lived, self-organizing crypt-villus organoids in the absence of non-epithelial niche cells. Here we find a close physical association of Lgr5 stem cells with Paneth cells in mice, both in vivo and in vitro. CD24(+) Paneth cells express EGF, TGF-$\alpha$, Wnt3 and the Notch ligand Dll4, all essential signals for stem-cell maintenance in culture. Co-culturing of sorted stem cells with Paneth cells markedly improves organoid formation. This Paneth cell requirement can be substituted by a pulse of exogenous Wnt. Genetic removal of Paneth cells in vivo results in the concomitant loss of Lgr5 stem cells. In colon crypts, CD24(+) cells residing between Lgr5 stem cells may represent the Paneth cell equivalents. We conclude that Lgr5 stem cells compete for essential niche signals provided by a specialized daughter cell, the Paneth cell.},

abstract = {The mitogenic activity of membrane-associated tyrosine kinases such as Src and the PDGF receptor appear to depend on Ras function. Ras biochemical activity involves regulation of a GTP/GDP cycle and the GTPase activating protein (GAP). Recently, PDGF and v-Src have been shown to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of GAP, linking these pathways at the biochemical level. To test whether PDGF and v-Src affect the Ras GTP/GDP cycle, we have measured the guanine nucleotides complexed to Ras in NIH3T3 cells and compared the ratio of GTP to total GTP + GDP detected (percent GTP). In normal quiescent NIH3T3 cells, PDGF stimulated the basal amount of GTP complexed to Ras (7{\%}) by 2.1-fold to 15{\%}. The effect was dependent on PDGF concentration and was observed maximally within 10 min following PDGF challenge. Ras was complexed to 22{\%} GTP in NIH3T3 cells transformed by v-src or v-abl. Overexpression of GAP by 110-fold in NIH3T3 cells reduced the basal level of GTP complexed to Ras to 2.4{\%}; upon challenge with PDGF, Ras was complexed to 6.6{\%} GTP. These results indicate that PDGF receptor activation and tyrosine kinase-encoding oncogene products can stimulate Ras into the GTP complex and that GAP in intact mammalian cells can decrease the amount of GTP complexed to Ras.},

abstract = {A novel alteration in exon 1 of KRAS was detected by single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of DNA amplified from the bone marrow of a 4-year-old child with myeloid leukemia. Sequencing of this mutant allele revealed an insertion of three nucleotides between codons 10 and 11 resulting in an in-frame insertion of glycine. Expression of the mutant protein in NIH 3T3 cells caused cellular transformation, and expression in COS cells activated the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. Surprisingly, Ras.GTP levels measured in COS cells established that this novel mutant accumulates to 90{\%} in the GTP state, considerably higher than a residue 12 mutant. Biochemical analysis confirmed that the higher Ras.GTP levels correspond to a dramatic decrease in intrinsic GTP hydrolysis as well as resistance to GTPase-activating proteins. This mutation is the first dominant Ras mutation found in human cancer that does not involve residues 12, 13, or 61, and its biochemical properties should help elucidate the mechanism of oncogenic activation.},

@article{Kadir2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is quite important to simulate the metabolic changes of a cell in response to the change in culture environment and/or specific gene knockouts particularly for the purpose of application in industry. If this could be done, the cell design can be made without conducting exhaustive experiments, and one can screen out the promising candidates, proceeded by experimental verification of a select few of particular interest. Although several models have so far been proposed, most of them focus on the specific metabolic pathways. It is preferred to model the whole of the main metabolic pathways in Escherichia coli, allowing for the estimation of energy generation and cell synthesis, based on intracellular fluxes and that may be used to characterize phenotypic growth.

RESULTS: In the present study, we considered the simulation of the main metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, TCA cycle, pentose phosphate (PP) pathway, and the anapleorotic pathways using enzymatic reaction models of E. coli. Once intracellular fluxes were computed by this model, the specific ATP production rate, the specific COâ production rate, and the specific NADPH production rate could be estimated. The specific ATP production rate thus computed was used for the estimation of the specific growth rate. The COâ production rate could be used to estimate cell yield, and the specific NADPH production rate could be used to determine the flux of the oxidative PP pathway. The batch and continuous cultivations were simulated where the changing patterns of extracellular and intra-cellular metabolite concentrations were compared with experimental data. Moreover, the effects of the knockout of such pathways as Ppc, Pck and Pyk on the metabolism were simulated. It was shown to be difficult for the cell to grow in Ppc mutant due to low concentration of OAA, while Pck mutant does not necessarily show this phenomenon. The slower growth rate of the Ppc mutant was properly estimated by taking into account the lower specific ATP production rate. In the case of Pyk mutant, the enzyme level regulation was made clear such that Pyk knockout caused PEP concentration to be up-regulated and activated Ppc, which caused the increase in MAL concentration and backed up reduced PYR through Mez, resulting in the phenotypic growth characteristics similar to the wild type.

CONCLUSIONS: It was shown to be useful to simulate the main metabolism of E. coli for understanding metabolic changes inside the cell in response to specific pathway gene knockouts, considering the whole main metabolic pathways. The comparison of the simulation result with the experimental data indicates that the present model could simulate the effect of the specific gene knockouts to the changes in the metabolisms to some extent.},

abstract = {Models of transcription are often built around a picture of RNA polymerase and transcription factors (TFs) acting on a single copy of a promoter. However, most TFs are shared between multiple genes with varying binding affinities. Beyond that, genes often exist at high copy number-in multiple identical copies on the chromosome or on plasmids or viral vectors with copy numbers in the hundreds. Using a thermodynamic model, we characterize the interplay between TF copy number and the demand for that TF. We demonstrate the parameter-free predictive power of this model as a function of the copy number of the TF and the number and affinities ofÂ the available specific binding sites; such predictive control is important for the understanding of transcription and the desire to quantitatively design theÂ output of genetic circuits. Finally, we use these experiments to dynamically measure plasmid copy number through the cell cycle.},

abstract = {Isogenic E. coli cells growing in a constant environment display significant variability in growth rates, division sizes, and generation times. The guiding principle appears to be that each cell, during one generation, adds a size increment that is uncorrelated to its birth size. Here, we investigate the mechanisms underlying this âadderâ behavior by mapping the chromosome replication cycle to the division cycle of individual cells using fluorescence microscopy. We have found that initiation of chromosome replication is triggered at a fixed volume per chromosome independent of a cell's birth volume and growth rate. Each initiation event is coupled to a division event after a growth-rate-dependent time. We formalize our findings in a model showing that cell-to-cell variation in division timing and cell size is mainly driven by variations in growth rate. The model also explains why fast-growing cells display adder behavior and correctly predict deviations from the adder behavior at slow growth.},

@article{Ollivier2010,
abstract = {Much of the complexity of biochemical networks comes from the information-processing abilities of allosteric proteins, be they receptors, ion-channels, signalling molecules or transcription factors. An allosteric protein can be uniquely regulated by each combination of input molecules that it binds. This "regulatory complexity" causes a combinatorial increase in the number of parameters required to fit experimental data as the number of protein interactions increases. It therefore challenges the creation, updating, and re-use of biochemical models. Here, we propose a rule-based modelling framework that exploits the intrinsic modularity of protein structure to address regulatory complexity. Rather than treating proteins as "black boxes", we model their hierarchical structure and, as conformational changes, internal dynamics. By modelling the regulation of allosteric proteins through these conformational changes, we often decrease the number of parameters required to fit data, and so reduce over-fitting and improve the predictive power of a model. Our method is thermodynamically grounded, imposes detailed balance, and also includes molecular cross-talk and the background activity of enzymes. We use our Allosteric Network Compiler to examine how allostery can facilitate macromolecular assembly and how competitive ligands can change the observed cooperativity of an allosteric protein. We also develop a parsimonious model of G protein-coupled receptors that explains functional selectivity and can predict the rank order of potency of agonists acting through a receptor. Our methodology should provide a basis for scalable, modular and executable modelling of biochemical networks in systems and synthetic biology.},

We show that this failure is caused by imbalanced reactions in glycolysis, the essential pathway in energy metabolism in most organisms. The imbalance arises largely from the fundamental design of glycolysis, making this state of glycolysis a generic risk. Cells with unbalanced glycolysis coexisted with vital cells. Spontaneous, nongenetic metabolic variability among individual cells determines which state is reached and, consequently, which cells survive. Transient ATP (adenosine 5'-triphosphate) hydrolysis through futile cycling reduces the probability of reaching the imbalanced state. Our results reveal dynamic behavior of glycolysis and indicate that cell fate can be determined by heterogeneity purely at the metabolic level.},

abstract = {Cell contact, movement and directionality are important factors in biological development (morphogenesis), and myxobacteria are a model system for studying cell-cell interaction and cell organization preceding differentiation. When starved, thousands of myxobacteria cells align, stream and form aggregates which later develop into round, non-motile spores. Canonically, cell aggregation has been attributed to attractive chemotaxis, a long range interaction, but there is growing evidence that myxobacteria organization depends on contact-mediated cell-cell communication. We present a discrete stochastic model based on contact-mediated signaling that suggests an explanation for the initialization of early aggregates, aggregation dynamics and final aggregate distribution. Our model qualitatively reproduces the unique structures of myxobacteria aggregates and detailed stages which occur during myxobacteria aggregation: first, aggregates initialize in random positions and cells join aggregates by random walk; second, cells redistribute by moving within transient streams connecting aggregates. Streams play a critical role in final aggregate size distribution by redistributing cells among fewer, larger aggregates. The mechanism by which streams redistribute cells depends on aggregate sizes and is enhanced by noise. Our model predicts that with increased internal noise, more streams would form and streams would last longer. Simulation results suggest a series of new experiments.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent years have seen a dramatic increase in the use of mathematical modeling to gain insight into gene regulatory network behavior across many different organisms. In particular, there has been considerable interest in using mathematical tools to understand how multistable regulatory networks may contribute to developmental processes such as cell fate determination. Indeed, such a network may subserve the formation of unicellular leaf hairs (trichomes) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. RESULTS: In order to investigate the capacity of small gene regulatory networks to generate multiple equilibria, we present a chemical reaction network (CRN)-based modeling formalism and describe a number of methods for CRN analysis in a parameter-free context. These methods are compared and applied to a full set of one-component subnetworks, as well as a large random sample from 40,680 similarly constructed two-component subnetworks. We find that positive feedback and cooperativity mediated by transcription factor (TF) dimerization is a requirement for one-component subnetwork bistability. For subnetworks with two components, the presence of these processes increases the probability that a randomly sampled subnetwork will exhibit multiple equilibria, although we find several examples of bistable two-component subnetworks that do not involve cooperative TF-promoter binding. In the specific case of epidermal differentiation in Arabidopsis, dimerization of the GL3-GL1 complex and cooperative sequential binding of GL3-GL1 to the CPC promoter are each independently sufficient for bistability. CONCLUSION: Computational methods utilizing CRN-specific theorems to rule out bistability in small gene regulatory networks are far superior to techniques generally applicable to deterministic ODE systems. Using these methods to conduct an unbiased survey of parameter-free deterministic models of small networks, and the Arabidopsis epidermal cell differentiation subnetwork in particular, we illustrate how future experimental research may be guided by network structure analysis.},

@article{Nevozhay2009,
abstract = {Although several recent studies have focused on gene autoregulation, the effects of negative feedback (NF) on gene expression are not fully understood. Our purpose here was to determine how the strength of NF regulation affects the characteristics of gene expression in yeast cells harboring chromosomally integrated transcriptional cascades that consist of the yEGFP reporter controlled by (i) the constitutively expressed tetracycline repressor TetR or (ii) TetR repressing its own expression. Reporter gene expression in the cascade without feedback showed a steep (sigmoidal) dose-response and a wide, nearly bimodal yEGFP distribution, giving rise to a noise peak at intermediate levels of induction. We developed computational models that reproduced the steep dose-response and the noise peak and predicted that negative autoregulation changes reporter expression from bimodal to unimodal and transforms the dose-response from sigmoidal to linear. Prompted by these predictions, we constructed a "linearizer" circuit by adding TetR autoregulation to our original cascade and observed a massive (7-fold) reduction of noise at intermediate induction and linearization of dose-response before saturation. A simple mathematical argument explained these findings and indicated that linearization is highly robust to parameter variations. These findings have important implications for gene expression control in eukaryotic cells, including the design of synthetic expression systems.},

abstract = {The prolific use of green fluorescent protein and its variants throughout cellular biology relies on the post-translational formation of the chromophore, which proceeds without the need for any additional enzymes or cofactors, except molecular oxygen. In order to form the mature chromophore, the polypeptide backbone must undergo four distinct processes: folding, cyclisation, oxidation and dehydration. This tutorial review looks in detail at the proposed mechanisms for chromophore formation arising out of experimental and computational studies. The folding process is discussed, and the role that the native state plays in catalysing the initial cyclisation and subsequent chemistry is analysed. The specific functions of four conserved residues (Y66, G67, R96 and E222) in the maturation process are also presented. A greater understanding of the maturation process of fluorescent proteins from both jellyfish and coral species will profit the ongoing quest for brighter, faster maturing, genetically-encodable fluorescent probes of all colours, thus increasing their utility throughout the biomedical sciences.},

abstract = {Thymocytes convert graded T cell receptor (TCR) signals into positive selection or deletion, and activation of extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), p38, and Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) has been postulated to play a discriminatory role. Two families of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RasGEFs), SOS and RasGRP, activate Ras and the downstream RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. The pathways leading to lymphocyte p38 and JNK activation are less well defined. We previously described how RasGRP alone induces analog Ras-ERK activation while SOS and RasGRP cooperate to establish bimodal ERK activation. Here we employed computational modeling and biochemical experiments with model cell lines and thymocytes to show that TCR-induced ERK activation grows exponentially in thymocytes and that a W729E allosteric pocket mutant, SOS1, can only reconstitute analog ERK signaling. In agreement with RasGRP allosterically priming SOS, exponential ERK activation is severely decreased by pharmacological or genetic perturbation of the phospholipase C$\gamma$ (PLC$\gamma$)-diacylglycerol-RasGRP1 pathway. In contrast, p38 activation is not sharply thresholded and requires high-level TCR signal input. Rac and p38 activation depends on SOS1 expression but not allosteric activation. Based on computational predictions and experiments exploring whether SOS functions as a RacGEF or adaptor in Rac-p38 activation, we established that the presence of SOS1, but not its enzymatic activity, is critical for p38 activation.},

@article{Molenaar2009,
abstract = {The growth rate-dependent regulation of cell size, ribosomal content, and metabolic efficiency follows a common pattern in unicellular organisms: with increasing growth rates, cell size and ribosomal content increase and a shift to energetically inefficient metabolism takes place. The latter two phenomena are also observed in fast growing tumour cells and cell lines. These patterns suggest a fundamental principle of design. In biology such designs can often be understood as the result of the optimization of fitness. Here we show that in basic models of self-replicating systems these patterns are the consequence of maximizing the growth rate. Whereas most models of cellular growth consider a part of physiology, for instance only metabolism, the approach presented here integrates several subsystems to a complete self-replicating system. Such models can yield fundamentally different optimal strategies. In particular, it is shown how the shift in metabolic efficiency originates from a tradeoff between investments in enzyme synthesis and metabolic yields for alternative catabolic pathways. The models elucidate how the optimization of growth by natural selection shapes growth strategies.},

It also outlines the contribution of single-molecule methods in defining the forces that drive the formation and dynamics of these membrane domains.},

abstract = {Dosage compensation equalizes X-linked gene products between the sexes. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the dosage compensation complex (DCC) binds both X chromosomes in XX animals and halves the transcription from each. The DCC is recruited to the X chromosomes by a number of loci, rex sites, and is thought to spread from these sites by an unknown mechanism to cover the rest of the chromosome. Here we describe a novel class of DCC-binding elements that we propose serve as "way stations" for DCC binding and spreading. Both rex sites and way stations comprise strong foci of DCC binding on the native X chromosome. However, rex sites maintain their ability to bind large amounts of DCC even on X duplications detached from the native X, while way stations do not. These results suggest that two distinct classes of DCC-binding elements facilitate recruitment and spreading of the DCC along the X chromosome.},

@article{Patterson2000,
abstract = {Two-photon excitation microscopy was used to image and quantify NAD(P)H autofluorescence from intact pancreatic islets under glucose stimulation. At maximal glucose stimulation, the rise in whole-cell NAD(P)H levels was estimated to be approximately 30 microM. However, because glucose-stimulated insulin secretion involves both glycolytic and Kreb's cycle metabolism, islets were cultured on extracellular matrix that promotes cell spreading and allows spatial resolution of the NAD(P)H signals from the cytoplasm and mitochondria. The metabolic responses in these two compartments are shown to be differentially stimulated by various nutrient applications. The glucose-stimulated increase of NAD(P)H fluorescence within the cytoplasmic domain is estimated to be approximately 7 microM. Likewise, the NAD(P)H increase of the mitochondrial domain is approximately 60 microM and is delayed with respect to the change in cytoplasmic NAD(P)H by approximately 20 sec. The large mitochondrial change in glucose-stimulated NAD(P)H thus dominates the total signal but may depend on the smaller but more rapid cytoplasmic increase.},

Here we will argue that to understand the abilities of cells we need to understand their stochastic nature. New experimental techniques allow gene expression to be followed in single cells over time and reveal stochastic bursts of both mRNA and protein synthesis in many different types of organisms. Stochasticity has been shown to be exploited by bacteria and viruses to decide between different behaviours. In fluctuating environments, cells that respond stochastically can out-compete those that sense environmental changes, and stochasticity may even have contributed to chromosomal gene order. We will focus on advances in modelling stochasticity, in understanding its effects on evolution and cellular design, and on means by which it may be exploited in biotechnology and medicine.},

The genome is organized in a way that facilitates chromosome maintenance and processing. Despite huge efforts, until recently little has been known about how the chromosome is organized within cells, where replication takes place, and how DNA is segregated before cell division. New techniques for labeling genetic loci and molecular machines are allowing the simultaneous tracking of genetic loci and such machines in living cells over time. These studies reveal remarkable organization, yet a highly dynamic flux of genetic loci and macromolecules. It seems likely that the cellular positioning of chromosomal loci is the outcome of the formation of two chromosome arms (replichores) by replication, followed by sequential chromosome segregation, rather than from the presence of cellular positioning markers. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We have previously shown that trivalent arsenic (arsenite, As(3+)) is able to induce GADD45 alpha expression in human bronchial epithelial cells through activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase and nucleolin-dependent mRNA stabilization. In the present report, we show that As(3+) is capable of inducing translation of the GADD45 alpha protein through a cap-independent, or rather, an internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent mechanism. In growth-arrested cells, As(3+) elevated the GADD45 alpha protein level in a dose- and time-dependent manner which did not correlate with the GADD45 alpha mRNA expression. Pretreatment of the cells with rapamycin, an inhibitor for the cap-dependent translation machinery through the suppression of mTOR and p70S6 kinase, failed to affect the induction of the GADD45 alpha protein induced by As(3+). Sequence analysis revealed a potential IRES element in the 5'-untranslated region of the GADD45 alpha mRNA. This IRES element in the 5'-untranslated region of the GADD45 alpha mRNA is functional in mediating As(3+)-induced translation of the GADD45 alpha protein in a dicistronic reporter gene activity assay. Immunoprecipitation and proteomic studies suggest that As(3+) impairs the assembly of the cap-dependent initiating complex for general protein translation but increases the association of human elongation factor 2 and human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotin with this complex. Thus, these results suggest that in growth-arrested cells, As(3+) is still capable of inducing GADD45 alpha expression through an IRES-dependent translational regulation.},

abstract = {Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) toxins are a recently identiï¬ed family of polymorphic toxins, initially found in Escherichia coli. CDI toxins are found widely spread in Gram-negative bacterial species, including pathogenic strains, and have been shown to possess a wide range of toxin types which are effective against other bacteria. This research shows that the E. coli EC93 CDI system confers a competitive advantage on bacteria growing in multi strain bioï¬lms with susceptible bacteria. This advantage is due to two factors, ï¬rstly the EC93 CDI toxin was shown to be capable of inhibiting the growth of susceptible bacteria in a bioï¬lm and secondly the conserved region of the EC93 CdiA protein was found to increase the rate of bioï¬lm formation. Analysis of the effects of the EC93 and EC869o11 CDI toxins at the single cell level showed that different classes of CDI toxins can act at different rates and with varying degrees of reversibility. Understanding the variable impact of CDI toxins, in concert with CDI's role in enhancing bioï¬lm formation, aids our understanding of bacterial competition in the natural environment.},

Comparison of multiple structures of CAP-DNA complexes has revealed the contributions of direct and indirect readout to DNA binding by CAP. The structure of the CAP-$\alpha$CTD-DNA complex has provided the first structural description of interactions between a transcription activator and its functional target within the general transcription machinery. Using the structure of the CAP-$\alpha$CTD-DNA complex, the structure of an RNA polymerase-DNA complex, and restraints from biophysical, biochemical and genetic experiments, it has been possible to construct detailed three-dimensional models of intact class I and class II transcription activation complexes.},

@article{Fokkens2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The study of biological networks and how they have evolved is fundamental to our understanding of the cell. By investigating how proteins of different ages are connected in the protein interaction network, one can infer how that network has expanded in evolution, without the need for explicit reconstruction of ancestral networks. Studies that implement this approach show that proteins are often connected to proteins of a similar age, suggesting a simultaneous emergence of interacting proteins. There are several theories explaining this phenomenon, but despite the importance of gene duplication in genome evolution, none consider protein family dynamics as a contributing factor.

RESULTS: In an S. cerevisiae protein interaction network we investigate to what extent edges that arise from duplication events contribute to the observed tendency to interact with proteins of a similar age. We find that part of this tendency is explained by interactions between paralogs. Age is usually defined on the level of protein families, rather than individual proteins, hence paralogs have the same age. The major contribution however, is from interaction partners that are shared between paralogs. These interactions have most likely been conserved after a duplication event. To investigate to what extent a nearly neutral process of network growth can explain these results, we adjust a well-studied network growth model to incorporate protein families. Our model shows that the number of edges between paralogs can be amplified by subsequent duplication events, thus explaining the overrepresentation of interparalog edges in the data. The fact that interaction partners shared by paralogs are often of the same age as the paralogs does not arise naturally from our model and needs further investigation.

CONCLUSION: We amend previous theories that explain why proteins of a similar age prefer to interact by demonstrating that this observation can be partially explained by gene duplication events. There is an ongoing debate on whether the protein interaction network is predominantly shaped by duplication and subfunctionalization or whether network rewiring is most important. Our analyses of S. cerevisiae protein interaction networks demonstrate that duplications have influenced at least one property of the protein interaction network: how proteins of different ages are connected.},

abstract = {Diffusion of a two component fluid is studied in the framework of differential equations, but where these equations are systematically derived from a well-defined microscopic model. The model has a finite carrying capacity imposed upon it at the mesoscopic level and this is shown to lead to nonlinear cross diffusion terms that modify the conventional Fickean picture. After reviewing the derivation of the model, the experiments carried out to test the model are described. It is found that it can adequately explain the dynamics of two dense ink drops simultaneously evolving in a container filled with water. The experiment shows that molecular crowding results in the formation of a dynamical barrier that prevents the mixing of the drops. This phenomenon is successfully captured by the model. This suggests that the proposed model can be justifiably viewed as a generalization of standard diffusion to a multispecies setting, where crowding and steric interferences are taken into account.},

abstract = {Chemoreceptors McpB and McpC in Salmonella enterica have been reported to promote chemotaxis in LB motility-plate assays. Of the chemicals tested as potential effectors of these receptors, the only response was towards L-cysteine and its oxidized form, L-cystine. Although enhanced radial migration in plates suggested positive chemotaxis to both amino acids, capillary assays failed to show an attractant response to either, in cells expressing only these two chemoreceptors. In vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) measurements of kinase activity revealed that in wild-type bacteria, cysteine and cystine are chemoeffectors of opposing sign, the reduced form being a chemoattractant and the oxidized form a repellent. The attractant response to cysteine was mediated primarily by Tsr, as reported earlier for Escherichia coli. The repellent response to cystine was mediated by McpB/C. Adaptive recovery upon cystine exposure required the methyl-transferase/-esterase pair, CheR/CheB, but restoration of kinase activity was never complete (i.e. imperfect adaptation). We provide a plausible explanation for the attractant-like responses to both cystine and cysteine in motility plates, and speculate that the opposing signs of response to this redox pair might afford Salmonella a mechanism to gauge and avoid oxidative environments.},

Using Smoldyn, we modeled pheromone response system signaling among yeast cells of opposite mating type. This model showed that secreted Bar1 protease might help a cell identify the fittest mating partner by sharpening the pheromone concentration gradient. This model involved about 200,000 protein molecules, about 7000 cubic microns of volume, and about 75 minutes of simulated time; it took about 10 hours to run.

In this procedure, recombination requires the phage lambda Red recombinase, which is synthesized under the control of an inducible promoter on an easily curable, low copy number plasmid. To demonstrate the utility of this approach, we generated PCR products by using primers with 36- to 50-nt extensions that are homologous to regions adjacent to the gene to be inactivated and template plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes that are flanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) sites. By using the respective PCR products, we made 13 different disruptions of chromosomal genes. Mutants of the arcB, cyaA, lacZYA, ompR-envZ, phnR, pstB, pstCA, pstS, pstSCAB-phoU, recA, and torSTRCAD genes or operons were isolated as antibiotic-resistant colonies after the introduction into bacteria carrying a Red expression plasmid of synthetic (PCR-generated) DNA. The resistance genes were then eliminated by using a helper plasmid encoding the FLP recombinase which is also easily curable. This procedure should be widely useful, especially in genome analysis of E. coli and other bacteria because the procedure can be done in wild-type cells.},

abstract = {The capacity of numerous bacterial species to tolerate antibiotics and other toxic compounds arises in part from the activity of energy-dependent transporters. In Gram-negative bacteria, many of these transporters form multicomponent 'pumps' that span both inner and outer membranes and are driven energetically by a primary or secondary transporter component. A model system for such a pump is the acridine resistance complex of Escherichia coli. This pump assembly comprises the outer-membrane channel TolC, the secondary transporter AcrB located in the inner membrane, and the periplasmic AcrA, which bridges these two integral membrane proteins. The AcrAB-TolC efflux pump is able to transport vectorially a diverse array of compounds with little chemical similarity, thus conferring resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics. Homologous complexes are found in many Gram-negative species, including in animal and plant pathogens. Crystal structures are available for the individual components of the pump and have provided insights into substrate recognition, energy coupling and the transduction of conformational changes associated with the transport process. However, how the subunits are organized in the pump, their stoichiometry and the details of their interactions are not known. Here we present the pseudo-atomic structure of a complete multidrug efflux pump in complex with a modulatory protein partner from E. coli. The model defines the quaternary organization of the pump, identifies key domain interactions, and suggests a cooperative process for channel assembly and opening. These findings illuminate the basis for drug resistance in numerous pathogenic bacterial species.},

The underlying regulatory network is complex and multifaceted: it ranges from slow interactions, such as changing gene expression, to rapid ones, such as the modulation of protein activity via post-translational modification or the allosteric binding of small molecules. In this Review, we outline the coordination of common metabolic tasks, including nutrient uptake, central metabolism, the generation of energy, the supply of amino acids and protein synthesis. Increasingly, a set of key metabolites is recognized to control individual regulatory circuits, which carry out specific functions of information input and regulatory output. Such a modular view of microbial metabolism facilitates an intuitive understanding of the molecular mechanisms that underlie cellular decision making.},

@article{Jans2009,
abstract = {In many species, a dosage compensation complex (DCC) is targeted to X chromosomes of one sex to equalize levels of X-gene products between males (1X) and females (2X). Here we identify cis-acting regulatory elements that target the Caenorhabditis elegans X chromosome for repression by the DCC. The DCC binds to discrete, dispersed sites on X of two types. rex sites (recruitment elements on X) recruit the DCC in an autonomous, DNA sequence-dependent manner using a 12-base-pair (bp) consensus motif that is enriched on X. This motif is critical for DCC binding, is clustered in rex sites, and confers much of X-chromosome specificity. Motif variants enriched on X by 3.8-fold or more are highly predictive (95{\%}) for rex sites. In contrast, dox sites (dependent on X) lack the X-enriched variants and cannot bind the DCC when detached from X. dox sites are more prevalent than rex sites and, unlike rex sites, reside preferentially in promoters of some expressed genes. These findings fulfill predictions for a targeting model in which the DCC binds to recruitment sites on X and disperses to discrete sites lacking autonomous recruitment ability. To relate DCC binding to function, we identified dosage-compensated and noncompensated genes on X. Unexpectedly, many genes of both types have bound DCC, but many do not, suggesting the DCC acts over long distances to repress X-gene expression. Remarkably, the DCC binds to autosomes, but at far fewer sites and rarely at consensus motifs. DCC disruption causes opposite effects on expression of X and autosomal genes. The DCC thus acts at a distance to impact expression throughout the genome.},

abstract = {Genetically identical cells grown in the same culture display striking cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression and other traits. A crucial challenge is to understand how much of this heterogeneity reflects the noise tolerance of a robust system and how much serves a biological function. In bacteria, stochastic gene expression results in cell-to-cell heterogeneity that might serve as a bet-hedging mechanism, allowing a few cells to survive through an antimicrobial treatment while others perish. Despite its clinical importance, the molecular mechanisms underlying bet hedging remain unclear. Here, we investigate the mechanisms of bet hedging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a new high-throughput microscopy assay that monitors variable protein expression, morphology, growth rate, and survival outcomes of tens of thousands of yeast microcolonies simultaneously. We find that clonal populations display broad distributions of growth rates and that slow growth predicts resistance to heat killing in a probabalistic manner. We identify several gene products that are likely to play a role in bet hedging and confirm that Tsl1, a trehalose-synthesis regulator, is an important component of this resistance. Tsl1 abundance correlates with growth rate and replicative age and predicts survival. Our results suggest that yeast bet hedging results from multiple epigenetic growth states determined by a combination of stochastic and deterministic factors.},

To determine the direct interaction between ArcA and the promoters of the fad regulon genes, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was performed. ChIP analysis suggested that ArcA directly binds to the promoter regions of the fad regulon genes in vivo. An ArcA-binding motif was identified from known binding sequences and predicted putative binding sites in the promoter regions of the fad regulon genes. These results indicate that ArcA directly represses the expression of fad regulon genes during anaerobic growth.},

abstract = {ATP is the dominant energy source in animals for mechanical and electrical work (for example, muscle contraction or neuronal firing). For chemical work, there is an equally important role for NADPH, which powers redox defence and reductive biosynthesis. The most direct route to produce NADPH from glucose is the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, with malic enzyme sometimes also important. Although the relative contribution of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to ATP production has been extensively analysed, similar analysis of NADPH metabolism has been lacking. Here we demonstrate the ability to directly track, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, the passage of deuterium from labelled substrates into NADPH, and combine this approach with carbon labelling and mathematical modelling to measure NADPH fluxes. In proliferating cells, the largest contributor to cytosolic NADPH is the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. Surprisingly, a nearly comparable contribution comes from serine-driven one-carbon metabolism, in which oxidation of methylene tetrahydrofolate to 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate is coupled to reduction of NADP(+) to NADPH. Moreover, tracing of mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism revealed complete oxidation of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate to make NADPH. As folate metabolism has not previously been considered an NADPH producer, confirmation of its functional significance was undertaken through knockdown of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD) genes. Depletion of either the cytosolic or mitochondrial MTHFD isozyme resulted in decreased cellular NADPH/NADP(+) and reduced/oxidized glutathione ratios (GSH/GSSG) and increased cell sensitivity to oxidative stress. Thus, although the importance of folate metabolism for proliferating cells has been long recognized and attributed to its function of producing one-carbon units for nucleic acid synthesis, another crucial function of this pathway is generating reducing power.},

abstract = {The first antibiotic of the ansamycin family, rifampicin (RIF), was isolated in 1959 and was introduced into therapy in 1962; it is still a first-line agent in the treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and various biofilm-related infections. The antimicrobial activity of RIF is due to its inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Most frequently, bacteria become resistant to RIF through mutation of the target; however, this mechanism is not unique. Other mechanisms of resistance have been reported, such as duplication of the target, action of RNAP-binding proteins, modification of RIF and modification of cell permeability. We suggest that several of these alternative resistance strategies could reflect the ecological function of RIF, such as autoregulation and/or signalling to surrounding microorganisms. Very often, resistance mechanisms found in the clinic have an environmental origin. One may ask whether the introduction of the RIF analogues rifaximin, rifalazil, rifapentine and rifabutin in the therapeutic arsenal, together with the diversification of the pathologies treated by these molecules, will diversify the resistance mechanisms of human pathogens against ansamycins.},

abstract = {The tetracycline resistance gene of pBR322 encodes a 41-kDa inner membrane protein (TetA) that acts as a tetracycline/H+ antiporter. Based on hydrophobicity profiles, we identified 12 potential transmembrane segments in TetA. We used oligonucleotide deletion mutagenesis to fuse alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) to the C-terminal edge of each of the predicted periplasmic and cytoplasmic segments of TetA. In general, the PhoA activities of the TetA-PhoA fusions support a TetA topology model consisting of 12 transmembrane segments with the N and C termini in the cytoplasm. However, several TetA-PhoA fusions have unexpected properties. One PhoA fusion to a predicted cytoplasmic segment (C6) has high activity. However, previous protease accessibility studies on the related Tn10 TetA protein indicated that C6 is cytoplasmically localized as predicted (Eckert, B., and Beck, C. F. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 11663-11670). PhoA fusions to three predicted periplasmic segments (P1, P2, and P5) have low to intermediate activity. In each case, the preceding transmembrane segment (TM1, TM3, and TM9) contains an aspartate (Asp17, Asp86, and Asp287). We show that these aspartates act like signal sequence mutations for PhoA export: (i) Asp----Ala mutations increase the PhoA activity of fusions to P1, P2, and P5. (ii) The signal sequence mutation suppressor prlA402 increases the PhoA activity of these same fusions. We also show that the aspartates in TM1, TM3, and TM9 are critical for wild-type TetA function; they are conserved in related TetA proteins and Asp----Ala mutations reduce or eliminate tetracycline resistance. The properties of the anomalous TetA-PhoA fusions suggest that TetA sequences C-terminal to some cytoplasmic and periplasmic segments are required for the proper localization of those segments, i.e. long range interactions may be more important in determining the membrane topology of TetA than suggested in some general models.},

The three strains displayed similar growth in planktonic growth-mode, but over expression of PotD protein greatly stimulated the formation of biofilms, while less biofilm formed by strain PotDi in comparison to strain PotD0. The expressions of five genes, recA, sfiA, groEL, groES, and gyrA, were increasingly expressed in PotD+ biofilm cells. Thus, PotD is likely to change the rate of polyamine synthesis, which stimulates the expression of SOS genes and biofilm formation.},

Time-lapse microscopy techniques are beginning to provide a direct view of circuit dynamics in individual living cells. Unexpectedly, we are discovering that key transcription and regulatory factors pulse on and off repeatedly, and often stochastically, even when cells are maintained in constant conditions. This type of spontaneous dynamic behavior is pervasive, appearing in diverse cell types from microbes to mammalian cells. Here, we review recent work showing how pulsing is generated and controlled by underlying regulatory circuits and how it provides critical capabilities to cells in stress response, signaling, and development. A major theme is the ability of pulsing to enable time-based regulation analogous to strategies used in engineered systems. Thus, pulsatile dynamics is emerging as a central, and still largely unexplored, layer of temporal organization in the cell.},

@article{Willett2015,
abstract = {Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) systems function to deliver toxins into neighboring bacterial cells. CDI+ bacteria export filamentous CdiA effector proteins, which extend from the inhibitor-cell surface to interact with receptors on neighboring target bacteria. Upon binding its receptor, CdiA delivers a toxin derived from its C-terminal region. CdiA C-terminal (CdiA-CT) sequences are highly variable between bacteria, reflecting the multitude of CDI toxin activities. Here, we show that several CdiA-CT regions are composed of two domains, each with a distinct function during CDI. The C-terminal domain typically possesses toxic nuclease activity, whereas the N-terminal domain appears to control toxin transport into target bacteria. Using genetic approaches, we identified ptsG, metI, rbsC, gltK/gltJ, yciB, and ftsH mutations that confer resistance to specific CdiA-CTs. The resistance mutations all disrupt expression of inner-membrane proteins, suggesting that these proteins are exploited for toxin entry into target cells. Moreover, each mutation only protects against inhibition by a subset of CdiA-CTs that share similar N-terminal domains. We propose that, following delivery of CdiA-CTs into the periplasm, the N-terminal domains bind specific inner-membrane receptors for subsequent translocation into the cytoplasm. In accord with this model, we find that CDI nuclease domains are modular payloads that can be redirected through different import pathways when fused to heterologous N-terminal "translocation domains." These results highlight the plasticity of CDI toxin delivery and suggest that the underlying translocation mechanisms could be harnessed to deliver other antimicrobial agents into Gram-negative bacteria.},

@article{Zarkower2006,
abstract = {C. elegans occurs in two natural sexes, the XX hermaphrodite and the XO male, which differ extensively in anatomy, physiology, and behavior. All somatic differences between the sexes result from the differential activity of a "global" sex determination regulatory pathway. This pathway also controls X chromosome dosage compensation, which is coordinated with sex determination by the action of the three SDC proteins. The SDC proteins control somatic and germline sex by transcriptional repression of the her-1 gene. HER-1 is a secreted protein that controls a regulatory module consisting of a transmembrane receptor, TRA-2, three intracellular FEM proteins, and the zinc finger transcription factor TRA-1. The molecular workings of this regulatory module are still being elucidated. Similarity of TRA-2 to patched receptors and of TRA-1 to GLI proteins suggests that parts of the global pathway originally derived from a Hedgehog signaling pathway. TRA-1 controls all aspects of somatic sexual differentiation, presumably by regulating a variety of tissue- and cell-specific downstream targets, including the cell death regulator EGL-1 and the male sexual regulator MAB-3. Sex determination evolves rapidly, and conservation of sexual regulators between phyla has been elusive. An apparent exception involves DM domain proteins, including MAB-3, which control sexual differentiation in nematodes, arthropods, and vertebrates. Important issues needing more study include the detailed molecular mechanisms of the global pathway, the identities of additional sexual regulators acting in the global pathway and downstream of TRA-1, and the evolutionary history of the sex determination pathway. Recently developed genetic and genomic technologies and comparative studies in divergent species have begun to address these issues.},

abstract = {The lactose operon regulation in Escherichia coli is a primary model of phenotypic switching, reminiscent of cell fate determination in higher organisms. Under conditions of bistability, an isogenic cell population partitions into two subpopulations, with the operon's genes turned on or remaining off. It is generally hypothesized that the final state of a cell depends solely on stochastic fluctuations of the network's protein concentrations, particularly on bursts of lactose permease expression. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying the cell switching decision are not fully understood. We designed a microfluidic system to follow the formation of a transiently bimodal population within growing microcolonies. The analysis of genealogy and cell history revealed the existence of pre-disposing factors for switching that are epigenetically inherited. Both the pre-induction expression stochasticity of the lactose operon repressor LacI and the cellular growth rate are predictive factors of the cell's response upon induction, with low LacI concentration and slow growth correlating with higher switching probability. Thus, stochasticity at the local level of the network and global physiology are synergistically involved in cell response determination.},

We confirmed the enterotypes also in two published, larger cohorts suggesting that intestinal microbiota variation is generally stratified, not continuous. This further indicates the existence of a limited number of well-balanced host-microbial symbiotic states that might respond differently to diet and drug intake. The enterotypes are mostly driven by species composition, but abundant molecular functions are not necessarily provided by abundant species, highlighting the importance of a functional analysis for a community understanding.

abstract = {Many cellular components are present in such low numbers per cell that random births and deaths of individual molecules can cause substantial "noise" in concentrations. But biochemical events do not necessarily occur in single steps of individual molecules. Some processes are greatly randomized when synthesis or degradation occurs in large bursts of many molecules during a short time interval. Conversely, each birth or death of a macromolecule could involve several small steps, creating a memory between individual events. We present a generalized theory for stochastic gene expression, formulating the variance in protein abundance in terms of the randomness of the individual gene expression events. We show that common types of molecular mechanisms can produce gestation and senescence periods that reduce noise without requiring higher abundances, shorter lifetimes, or any concentration-dependent control loops. We also show that most single-cell experimental methods cannot distinguish between qualitatively different stochastic principles, although this in turn makes such methods better suited for identifying which components introduce fluctuations. Characterizing the random events that give rise to noise in concentrations instead requires dynamic measurements with single-molecule resolution.},

abstract = {Expression profiling of eukaryotic genomes has revealed widespread transcription outside the confines of protein-coding genes, leading to production of antisense and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Studies in Schizosaccharomyces pombe and multicellular organisms suggest that transcription and ncRNAs provide a framework for the assembly of heterochromatin, which has been linked to various chromosomal processes. In addition to gene regulation, heterochromatin is crucial for centromere function, cell fate determination as well as transcriptional and posttranscriptional silencing of repetitive DNA elements. Recently, heterochromatin factors have been shown to suppress antisense RNAs at euchromatic loci. These findings define conserved pathways that probably have major impact on the epigenetic regulation of eukaryotic genomes.},

abstract = {Biology presents many examples of planar distribution and structural networks having dense sets of closed loops. An archetype of this form of network organization is the vasculature of dicotyledonous leaves, which showcases a hierarchically-nested architecture containing closed loops at many different levels. Although a number of approaches have been proposed to measure aspects of the structure of such networks, a robust metric to quantify their hierarchical organization is still lacking. We present an algorithmic framework, the hierarchical loop decomposition, that allows mapping loopy networks to binary trees, preserving in the connectivity of the trees the architecture of the original graph. We apply this framework to investigate computer generated graphs, such as artificial models and optimal distribution networks, as well as natural graphs extracted from digitized images of dicotyledonous leaves and vasculature of rat cerebral neocortex. We calculate various metrics based on the asymmetry, the cumulative size distribution and the Strahler bifurcation ratios of the corresponding trees and discuss the relationship of these quantities to the architectural organization of the original graphs. This algorithmic framework decouples the geometric information (exact location of edges and nodes) from the metric topology (connectivity and edge weight) and it ultimately allows us to perform a quantitative statistical comparison between predictions of theoretical models and naturally occurring loopy graphs.},

abstract = {A circadian clock coordinates physiology and behavior in diverse groups of living organisms. Another major cyclic cellular event, the cell cycle, is regulated by the circadian clock in the few cases where linkage of these cycles has been studied. In the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, the circadian clock gates cell division by an unknown mechanism. Using timelapse microscopy, we confirm the gating of cell division in the wild-type and demonstrate the regulation of cytokinesis by key clock components. Specifically, a state of the oscillator protein KaiC that is associated with elevated ATPase activity closes the gate by acting through a known clock output pathway to inhibit FtsZ ring formation at the division site. An activity that stimulates KaiC phosphorylation independently of the KaiA protein was also uncovered. We propose a model that separates the functions of KaiC ATPase and phosphorylation in cell division gating and other circadian behaviors. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Bacterial populations growing in a changing world must adjust their proteome composition in response to alterations in the environment. Rapid proteome responses to growth medium changes are expected to increase the average growth rate and fitness value of these populations. Little is known about the dynamics of proteome change, e.g., whether bacteria use optimal strategies of gene expression for rapid proteome adjustments and if there are lower bounds to the time of proteome adaptation in response to growth medium changes. To begin answering these types of questions, we modeled growing bacteria as stoichiometrically coupled networks of metabolic pathways. These are balanced during steady-state growth in a constant environment but are initially unbalanced after rapid medium shifts due to a shortage of enzymes required at higher concentrations in the new environment. We identified an optimal strategy for rapid proteome adjustment in the absence of protein degradation and found a lower bound to the time of proteome adaptation after medium shifts. This minimal time is determined by the ratio between the Kullback-Leibler distance from the pre- to the postshift proteome and the postshift steady-state growth rate. The dynamics of optimally controlled proteome adaptation has a simple analytical solution. We used detailed numerical modeling to demonstrate that realistic bacterial control systems can emulate this optimal strategy for rapid proteome adaptation. Our results may provide a conceptual link between the physiology and population genetics of growing bacteria.},

Hereweinvestigate such an internal conflict within a microbial (Bacillus subtilis) biofilm community: cells in the biofilm periphery not only protect interior cells from external attack but also starve them through nutrient consumption. We discover that this conflict between protection and starvation is resolved through emergence of long-range metabolic co-dependence between peripheral and interior cells. As a result, biofilm growth halts periodically, increasing nutrient availability for the sheltered interior cells. We show that this collective oscillation in biofilm growth benefits the community in the event of a chemical attack. These findings indicate that oscillations support population-level conflict resolution by coordinating competing metabolic demands in space and time, suggesting new strategies to control biofilm growth.

abstract = {A significant goal in the post-genome era is to relate the annotated genome sequence to the physiological functions of a cell. Working from the annotated genome sequence, as well as biochemical and physiological information, it is possible to reconstruct complete metabolic networks. Furthermore, computational methods have been developed to interpret and predict the optimal performance of a metabolic network under a range of growth conditions. We have tested the hypothesis that Escherichia coli uses its metabolism to grow at a maximal rate using the E. coli MG1655 metabolic reconstruction. Based on this hypothesis, we formulated experiments that describe the quantitative relationship between a primary carbon source (acetate or succinate) uptake rate, oxygen uptake rate, and maximal cellular growth rate. We found that the experimental data were consistent with the stated hypothesis, namely that the E. coli metabolic network is optimized to maximize growth under the experimental conditions considered. This study thus demonstrates how the combination of in silico and experimental biology can be used to obtain a quantitative genotype-phenotype relationship for metabolism in bacterial cells.},

The resulting dicentric chromosomes can enter breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, thereby impeding elucidation of the structures of the initial fusion events and a mechanistic understanding of their genesis. Current models for the molecular basis of fusion of critically shortened, uncapped telomeres rely on PCR assays that typically capture fusion breakpoints created by direct ligation of chromosome ends. Here we use independent approaches that rely on distinctive features of Caenorhabditis elegans to study the frequency of direct end-to-end chromosome fusion in telomerase mutants: (1) holocentric chromosomes that allow for genetic isolation of stable end-to-end fusions and (2) unique subtelomeric sequences that allow for thorough PCR analysis of samples of genomic DNA harboring multiple end-to-end fusions. Surprisingly, only a minority of end-to-end fusion events resulted from direct end joining with no additional genome rearrangements. We also demonstrate that deficiency for the C. elegans Ku DNA repair heterodimer does not affect telomere length or cause synthetic effects in the absence of telomerase.},

Despite many elaborate theoretical models of how molecular self-organization can come about, only a few experimental systems of biological origin have so far been rigorously described, due mostly to their inherent complexity. The most promising strategy of modern biophysics is thus to identify minimal biological systems showing self-organized emergent behavior. One of the best-understood examples of protein self-organization, which has recently been successfully reconstituted in vitro, is represented by the oscillations of the Min proteins in Escherichia coli. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanism of Min protein self-organization in vivo and in vitro. We discuss the potential of the Min oscillations to sense the geometry of the cell and suggest that spontaneous protein waves could be a general means of intracellular organization. We hypothesize that cooperative membrane binding and unbinding, e.g., as an energy-dependent switch, may act as an important regulatory mechanism for protein oscillations and pattern formation in the cell.},

Reversal of SulA inhibition by blocking protein synthesis in SulA-induced filaments led to a resumption of FtsZ ring formation and division. These results suggested that these inhibitors block cell division by preventing FtsZ localization into the ring structure. In addition, analysis of min mutants demonstrated that FtsZ ring formation was also associated with minicell formation, indicating that all septation events in E. coli involve the FtsZ ring.},

abstract = {In all eukaryotes, histone variants are incorporated into a subset of nucleosomes to create functionally specialized regions of chromatin. One such variant, H2A.Z, replaces histone H2A and is required for development and viability in all animals tested to date. However, the function of H2A.Z in development remains unclear. Here, we use ChIP-chip, genetic mutation, RNAi, and immunofluorescence microscopy to interrogate the function of H2A.Z (HTZ-1) during embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans, a key model of metazoan development. We find that HTZ-1 is expressed in every cell of the developing embryo and is essential for normal development. The sites of HTZ-1 incorporation during embryogenesis reveal a genome wrought by developmental processes. HTZ-1 is incorporated upstream of 23{\%} of C. elegans genes. While these genes tend to be required for development and occupied by RNA polymerase II, HTZ-1 incorporation does not specify a stereotypic transcription program. The data also provide evidence for unexpectedly widespread independent regulation of genes within operons during development; in 37{\%} of operons, HTZ-1 is incorporated upstream of internally encoded genes. Fewer sites of HTZ-1 incorporation occur on the X chromosome relative to autosomes, which our data suggest is due to a paucity of developmentally important genes on X, rather than a direct function for HTZ-1 in dosage compensation. Our experiments indicate that HTZ-1 functions in establishing or maintaining an essential chromatin state at promoters regulated dynamically during C. elegans embryogenesis.},

abstract = {The persistence phenotype is an epigenetic trait exhibited by a subpopulation of bacteria, characterized by slow growth coupled with an ability to survive antibiotic treatment. The phenotype is acquired via a spontaneous, reversible switch between normal and persister cells. These observations suggest that clonal bacterial populations may use persister cells, whose slow division rate under growth conditions leads to lower population fitness, as an "insurance policy" against antibiotic encounters. We present a model of Escherichia coli persistence, and using experimentally derived parameters for both wild type and a mutant strain (hipQ) with markedly different switching rates, we show how fitness loss due to slow persister growth pays off as a risk-reducing strategy. We demonstrate that wild-type persistence is suited for environments in which antibiotic stress is a rare event. The optimal rate of switching between normal and persister cells is found to depend strongly on the frequency of environmental changes and only weakly on the selective pressures of any given environment. In contrast to typical examples of adaptations to features of a single environment, persistence appears to constitute an adaptation that is tuned to the distribution of environmental change.},

@article{Gefen2014,
abstract = {Exponentially growing bacteria are rarely found in the wild, as microorganisms tend to spend most of their lifetime at stationary phase. Despite this general prevalence of stationary-phase bacteria, they are as yet poorly characterized. Our goal was to quantitatively study this phase by direct observation of single bacteria as they enter into stationary phase and by monitoring their activity over several days during growth arrest. For this purpose, we devised an experimental procedure for starving single Escherichia coli bacteria in microfluidic devices and measured their activity by monitoring the production rate of fluorescent proteins. When amino acids were the sole carbon source, the production rate decreased by an order of magnitude upon entry into stationary phase. We found that, even while growth-arrested, bacteria continued to produce proteins at a surprisingly constant rate over several days. Our identification of this newly observed period of constant activity in nongrowing cells, designated as constant activity stationary phase, makes possible the conduction of assays that require constant protein expression over time, and are therefore difficult to perform under exponential growth conditions. Moreover, we show that exogenous protein expression bears no fitness cost on the regrowth of the population when starvation ends. Further characterization of constant activity stationary phase-a phase where nongrowing bacteria can be quantitatively studied over several days in a reproducible manner-should contribute to a better understanding of this ubiquitous but overlooked physiological state of bacteria in nature.},

abstract = {The quantitative study of the cell growth [1-5] has led to many fundamental insights in our understanding of a wide range of subjects, from the cell cycle [6-9] to senescence [10]. Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically [11] and symmetrically [12, 13] dividing organisms, implying that a "steady-state" population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of approximately 105 individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth whereby the mother cell inherits the same pole for hundreds of generations. We further show that death of E. coli is not purely stochastic but is the result of accumulating damages. We conclude that E. coli, unlike all other aging model systems studied to date, has a robust mechanism of growth that is decoupled from cell death. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Allen2003,
abstract = {The recent availability of heterogeneous high-throughput data types has increased the need for scalable in silico methods with which to integrate data related to the processes of regulation, protein synthesis, and metabolism. A sequence-based framework for modeling transcription and translation in prokaryotes has been established and has been extended to study the expression state of the entire Escherichia coli genome. The resulting in silico analysis of the expression state highlighted three facets of gene expression in E. coli: (i) the metabolic resources required for genome expression and protein synthesis were found to be relatively invariant under the conditions tested; (ii) effective promoter strengths were estimated at the genome scale by using global mRNA abundance and half-life data, revealing genes subject to regulation under the experimental conditions tested; and (iii) large-scale genome location-dependent expression patterns with approximately 600-kb periodicity were detected in the E. coli genome based on the 49 expression data sets analyzed. These results support the notion that a structured model-driven analysis of expression data yields additional information that can be subjected to commonly used statistical analyses. The integration of heterogeneous genome-scale data (i.e., sequence, expression data, and mRNA half-life data) is readily achieved in the context of an in silico model.},

An unbiased assessment of the relative efficacy of crowded and confined environments has been hampered so far by the paucity of homogeneous comparisons on the same protein. This paper reports spectroscopic studies on yeast frataxin (Yfh1), a protein which provides an excellent model system for stability studies since it undergoes both cold and heat denaturation at measurable temperatures. The stability of Yfh1 was evaluated in the presence of Ficoll 70 and inside the cavities of polyacrylamide gels as means of mimicking crowding and confinement. We find that both effects influence the thermal stability of Yfh1 to a comparable extent thus providing the first direct comparison of crowding and confinement on the same protein. Thanks to the measurement of the full stability curve we also present the first thermodynamic characterization of the stability of a protein in crowding conditions.},

abstract = {Sensing extracellular changes initiates signal transduction and is the first stage of cellular decision-making. Yet relatively little is known about why one form of sensing biochemistry has been selected over another. To gain insight into this question, we studied the sensing characteristics of one of the biochemically simplest of sensors: the allosteric transcription factor. Such proteins, common in microbes, directly transduce the detection of a sensed molecule to changes in gene regulation. Using the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model, we determined six sensing characteristics--the dynamic range, the Hill number, the intrinsic noise, the information transfer capacity, the static gain, and the mean response time--as a function of the biochemical parameters of individual sensors and of the number of sensors. We found that specifying one characteristic strongly constrains others. For example, a high dynamic range implies a high Hill number and a high capacity, and vice versa. Perhaps surprisingly, these constraints are so strong that most of the space of characteristics is inaccessible given biophysically plausible ranges of parameter values. Within our approximations, we can calculate the probability distribution of the numbers of input molecules that maximizes information transfer and show that a population of one hundred allosteric transcription factors can in principle distinguish between more than four bands of input concentrations. Our results imply that allosteric sensors are unlikely to have been selected for high performance in one sensing characteristic but for a compromise in the performance of many.},

abstract = {The catabolite gene activator protein (CAP) and the lac repressor regulate the transcriptional activity of the lactose operon. An early step in the regulatory functions of these proteins is their binding to specific DNA sequences within the lac promoter-operator region. Using the gel electrophoresis mobility-shift technique, we have found that the ternary complex with CAP and repressor bound to their respective highest affinity sites is 4 to 11-fold more stable than is predicted from the affinities of the independently bound proteins. This favorable binding interaction is unexpected, because CAP and lac repressor exert opposing effects on lac operon transcription. Deoxyribonuclease I footprinting analyses show that interacting proteins remain bound to the sites occupied when the proteins bind singly. These sites have a center-to-center separation of 72 base-pairs (corresponding to 6.9 turns of a B-form DNA helix), and thus occupy the same "faceâ of the DNA cylinder. Such an orientation is compatible with models of the ternary complex in which DNA curvature facilitates the interaction of CAP and lac repressor. {\textcopyright} 1990 Academic Press Limited.},

abstract = {Compelling evidence from many animal taxa indicates that male genitalia are often under postcopulatory sexual selection for characteristics that increase a male's relative fertilization success. There could, however, also be direct precopulatory female mate choice based on male genital traits. Before clothing, the nonretractable human penis would have been conspicuous to potential mates. This observation has generated suggestions that human penis size partly evolved because of female choice. Here we show, based upon female assessment of digitally projected life-size, computer-generated images, that penis size interacts with body shape and height to determine male sexual attractiveness. Positive linear selection was detected for penis size, but the marginal increase in attractiveness eventually declined with greater penis size (i.e., quadratic selection). Penis size had a stronger effect on attractiveness in taller men than in shorter men. There was a similar increase in the positive effect of penis size on attractiveness with a more masculine body shape (i.e., greater shoulder-to-hip ratio). Surprisingly, larger penis size and greater height had almost equivalent positive effects on male attractiveness. Our results support the hypothesis that female mate choice could have driven the evolution of larger penises in humans. More broadly, our results show that precopulatory sexual selection can play a role in the evolution of genital traits.},

abstract = {Contact-dependent growth inhibition (CDI) is a mechanism identified in Escherichia coli by which bacteria expressing two-partner secretion proteins encoded by cdiA and cdiB bind to BamA in the outer membranes of target cells and inhibit their growth. A third gene in the cluster, cdiI, encodes a small protein that is necessary and sufficient to confer immunity to CDI, thereby preventing cells expressing the cdiBA genes from inhibiting their own growth. In this study, the cdiI gene was placed under araBAD promoter control to modulate levels of the immunity protein and thereby induce CDI by removal of arabinose. This CDI autoinhibition system was used for metabolic analyses of a single population of E. coli cells undergoing CDI. Contact-inhibited cells showed altered cell morphology, including the presence of filaments. Notably, CDI was reversible, as evidenced by resumption of cell growth and normal cellular morphology following induction of the CdiI immunity protein. Recovery of cells from CDI also required an energy source. Cells undergoing CDI showed a significant, reversible downregulation of metabolic parameters, including aerobic respiration, proton motive force (Deltap), and steady-state ATP levels. It is unclear whether the decrease in respiration and/or Deltap is directly involved in growth inhibition, but a role for ATP in the CDI mechanism was ruled out using an atp mutant. Consistent with the observed decrease in Deltap, the phage shock response was induced in cells undergoing CDI but not in recovering cells, based on analysis of levels of pspA mRNA.},

In Drosophila melanogaster, upregulation of the male X leads to dosage compensation. It has been hypothesized that mammals likewise upregulate their active X chromosome. Together with X inactivation, this mechanism would maintain balanced expression between the X chromosome and autosomes and between the sexes. Here, we show that doubling of the global expression level of the X chromosome leads to dosage compensation in somatic tissues from several mammalian species. X-linked genes are highly expressed in brain tissues, consistent with a role in cognitive functions. Furthermore, the X chromosome is expressed but not upregulated in spermatids and secondary oocytes, preserving balanced expression of the genome in these haploid cells. Upon fertilization, upregulation of the active X must occur to achieve the observed dosage compensation in early embryos.},

This process is achieved in Caenorhabditis elegans by hermaphrodite-specific, dosage compensation complex (DCC)-mediated, 2-fold X chromosome downregulation. How the DCC downregulates gene expression is not known. By analyzing the distribution of histone modifications in nuclei using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we found that H4K16 acetylation (H4K16ac) is underrepresented and H4K20 monomethylation (H4K20me1) is enriched on hermaphrodite X chromosomes in a DCC-dependent manner. Depletion of H4K16ac also requires the conserved histone deacetylase SIR-2.1, while enrichment of H4K20me1 requires the activities of the histone methyltransferases SET-1 and SET-4. Our data suggest that the mechanism of dosage compensation in C. elegans involves redistribution of chromatin-modifying activities, leading to a depletion of H4K16ac and an enrichment of H4K20me1 on the X chromosomes. These results support conserved roles for histone H4 chromatin modification in worm dosage compensation analogous to those seen in flies, using similar elements and opposing strategies to achieve differential 2-fold changes in X-linked gene expression.},

abstract = {Dosage compensation ensures similar levels of X-linked gene products in males (XY or XO) and females (XX), despite their different numbers of X chromosomes. In mammals, flies, and worms, dosage compensation is mediated by a specialized machinery that localizes to one or both of the X chromosomes in one sex resulting in a change in gene expression from the affected X chromosome(s). In mammals and flies, dosage compensation is associated with specific histone posttranslational modifications and replacement with variant histones. Until now, no specific histone modifications or histone variants have been implicated in Caenorhabditis elegans dosage compensation. Taking a candidate approach, we have looked at specific histone modifications and variants on the C. elegans dosage compensated X chromosomes. Using RNAi-based assays, we show that reducing levels of the histone H2A variant, H2A.Z (HTZ-1 in C. elegans), leads to partial disruption of dosage compensation. By immunofluorescence, we have observed that HTZ-1 is under-represented on the dosage compensated X chromosomes, but not on the non-dosage compensated male X chromosome. We find that reduction of HTZ-1 levels by RNA interference (RNAi) and mutation results in only a very modest change in dosage compensation complex protein levels. However, in these animals, the X chromosome-specific localization of the complex is partially disrupted, with some nuclei displaying DCC localization beyond the X chromosome territory. We propose a model in which HTZ-1, directly or indirectly, serves to restrict the dosage compensation complex to the X chromosome by acting as or regulating the activity of an autosomal repellant.},

abstract = {The breadth of genomic diversity found among organisms in nature allows populations to adapt to diverse environments. However, genomic diversity is difficult to generate in the laboratory and new phenotypes do not easily arise on practical timescales. Although in vitro and directed evolution methods have created genetic variants with usefully altered phenotypes, these methods are limited to laborious and serial manipulation of single genes and are not used for parallel and continuous directed evolution of gene networks or genomes. Here, we describe multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for large-scale programming and evolution of cells. MAGE simultaneously targets many locations on the chromosome for modification in a single cell or across a population of cells, thus producing combinatorial genomic diversity. Because the process is cyclical and scalable, we constructed prototype devices that automate the MAGE technology to facilitate rapid and continuous generation of a diverse set of genetic changes (mismatches, insertions, deletions). We applied MAGE to optimize the 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP) biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to overproduce the industrially important isoprenoid lycopene. Twenty-four genetic components in the DXP pathway were modified simultaneously using a complex pool of synthetic DNA, creating over 4.3 billion combinatorial genomic variants per day. We isolated variants with more than fivefold increase in lycopene production within 3 days, a significant improvement over existing metabolic engineering techniques. Our multiplex approach embraces engineering in the context of evolution by expediting the design and evolution of organisms with new and improved properties.},

To eliminate the difference in the expression levels of these genes between sexes and to restore equal expression levels of the genes between sex chromosomes and autosomes, mechanisms of dosage compensation have appeared. Studies of three classical objects,Drosophila melanogaster,Caenorhabditis elegans, and mammals, have shown that dosage compensation of X-linked genes can be achieved through completely different chromosome-wide mechanisms. New data on sex chromosome gene expression demonstrating that many sex chromosome genes can be expressed at different levels in males and females were recently obtained from birds and butterflies. In this review, dosage compensation mechanisms inD. melanogaster,C. elegans, and mammals are considered and the data on sex chromosome gene expression in birds and butterflies, and their influence on our view of dosage compensation, are discussed.},

abstract = {Filamentous cells of Escherichia coli can be produced by treatment with the antibiotic cephalexin, which blocks cell division but allows cell growth. To explore the effect of cell size on chemotactic activity, we studied the motility and chemotaxis of filamentous cells. The filaments, up to 50 times the length of normal E. coli organisms, were motile and had flagella along their entire lengths. Despite their increased size, the motility and chemotaxis of filaments were very similar to those properties of normal-sized cells. Unstimulated filaments of chemotactically normal bacteria ran and stopped repeatedly (while normal-sized bacteria run and tumble repeatedly). Filaments responded to attractants by prolonged running (like normal-sized bacteria) and to repellents by prolonged stopping (unlike normal-sized bacteria, which tumble), until adaptation restored unstimulated behavior (as occurs with normal-sized cells). Chemotaxis mutants that always ran when they were normal sized always ran when they were filament sized, and those mutants that always tumbled when they were normal sized always stopped when they were filament sized. Chemoreceptors in filaments were localized to regions both at the poles and at intervals along the filament. We suggest that the location of the chemoreceptors enables the chemotactic responses observed in filaments. The implications of this work with regard to the cytoplasmic diffusion of chemotaxis components in normal-sized and filamentous E. coli are discussed.},

abstract = {Fluctuations in the abundance of molecules in the living cell may affect its growth and well being. For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or transcription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels of downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to investigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks. Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly interlinked, and noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the exactly soluble linear queuing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently, fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely shared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study metabolic networks with more complex topologies or protein signaling networks that are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for bioinformatic analysis of metabolomic data are discussed.},

One example is the C. elegans vulva, in which the final cell fate pattern is remarkably robust. Although this system has been extensively studied and the molecular network underlying cell fate specification is well understood, very little is known in quantitative terms. Here, through pathway dosage modulation and single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show that the system can tolerate a 4-fold variation in genetic dose of the upstream signaling molecule LIN-3/epidermal growth factor (EGF) without phenotypic change in cell fate pattern. Furthermore, through tissue-specific dosage perturbations of the EGF and Notch pathways, we determine the first-appearing patterning errors. Finally, by combining different doses of both pathways, we explore how quantitative pathway interactions influence system behavior. Our results highlight the feasibility and significance of launching experimental studies of robustness and quantitative network analysis in genetically tractable, multicellular eukaryotes.},

abstract = {In many cellular signaling pathways, key components form clusters at the cell membrane. Although much work has focused on the mechanisms behind such cluster formation, the implications for downstream signaling remain poorly understood. Here, motivated by recent experiments, we use particle-based simulation to study a covalent modification network in which the activating component is either clustered or randomly distributed on the membrane. We find that whereas clustering reduces the response of a single-modification network, it can enhance the response of a double-modification network. The reduction is a bulk effect: a cluster presents a smaller effective target to a substrate molecule in the bulk. The enhancement, on the other hand, is a local effect: a cluster promotes the rapid rebinding and second activation of singly activated substrate molecules. As such, the enhancement relies on frequent collisions on a short timescale, leading to an optimal ratio of diffusion to association that agrees with typical measured rates. We complement simulation with analytic results at both the mean-field and first-passage distribution levels. Our results emphasize the importance of spatially resolved models, showing that significant effects of spatial correlations persist even in spatially averaged quantities such as response curves.},
