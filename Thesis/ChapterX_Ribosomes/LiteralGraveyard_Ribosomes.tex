Nowadays, the structure of the ribosome has been unraveled.

It is known that the ribosome consists of 3 RNA molecules and 54 proteins \cite{Chen2013}.%, Lodish2003}.

\section{The Ribosome}





The ribosome is a vast RNA-protein complex. 
This complex is responsible for translating messenger RNA (mRNA) to proteins.


When expressed, any of \textit{E. coli}'s approximately 4288 genes \cite{Blattner1997} is first converted in messenger RNA (mrNA), and then into protein.
Despite this fact, only 3-4.5\% of the cell's RNA is mRNA.
%(organized into 2584 operons)


3-4.5\% mRNA
73-80\% rRNA
15-20\% tRNA

\cite{Norris1972}

%(For 55 minutes: 80\% and 15\%)

\section{Labeling proteins of the ribosome}

Table \ref{tab:ribosubunits} shows a list of the subunits we have currently labeled.

Given that the ribosome
