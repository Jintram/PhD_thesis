Martijn Wehrens (April 3rd, 1986) was born in Nijmegen, where he attented high school 
at the \textit{Nijmeegse Scholengemeenschap Groenewoud}.
%
He always had an interest in science and technology, 
and at that time for example working on building and programming moving little machines at an engineering club.
%
To understand the most complicated machine of all, life, he started to study biology at the Radboud University in Nijmegen in 2004.
%
In 2007 he realized that to fully grasp fundamental processes in the biological cell, 
one should delve deeper into the biochemical processes that go on in the cell.
%
%He therefore also joined the chemistry bachelor program.
Therefore, he began to 
%He therefore also started to 
study chemistry. 
%
In addition to his studies he also participated in the Honours program, with elective courses on free will, holy texts, community, and economics; 
% Gemeenschap en Utopie, Concepten van de vrije wil, Heilige teksten, Cultuur en Economie
worked as editor for the student magazine ANS; and was a member of the student council.
%
After finishing both the biology and chemistry bachelor program in 2010, he wanted to further understand the cell at the fundamental level.
%
He therefore joined the MSc program in chemistry at the University of Amsterdam.
%
During this theoretical program he focused on computer simulations of chemical processes.
%
This was also the topic of his MSc thesis, where he extended and used the eGFRD reaction-diffusion simulation algorithm to show that 
positive feedback in chemical reactions can contribute to clustering of receptor molecules on the surface of biological cells. 
%
This research was done in the Biochemical Networks research group of Prof. Pieter Rein ten Wolde at the AMOLF research institute in Amsterdam.
%
After completing the MSc program in chemistry in 2013, he further pursued his interest in biochemical networks 
by starting to work as a PhD student in the Prof. Sander J. Tans Biophysics group at AMOLF in January of 2014. 
%
The work on dynamical regulation in single cells he performed as a PhD student is described in this thesis.
