In this chapter, 
we investigated how the CRP regulatory networks responds to environmental inputs versus stochastic inputs.
%
A negative feedback loop, which inhibits CRP activity (through cAMP) and metabolic enzymes expression when metabolite concentrations increase,
is known to be responsible for adjusting metabolic enzyme expression to the growth medium of the cell.
%
We hypothesized that this regulatory interaction should respond equally strong to metabolite fluctuations that occur in the cell due to noise. 
%
We first investigated how the
