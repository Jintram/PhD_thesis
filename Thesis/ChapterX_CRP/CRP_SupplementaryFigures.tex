	\textbf{Regulation of the TCA cycle and ED pathway.} 
	Some regulatory proteins control the expression of many tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and/or enzymes glycolysis pathway simultaneously.
	This diagram shows the regulatory effects of CRP, but also of the Catabolite repressor activator (Cra) and the Anoxic redox control A (ArcA) protein.
	Cra controls the direction of the metabolite flux through metabolic pathways \cite{Keseler2017, Ramseier1995}. Cra is activated by the metabolite fructose-1,6-bisphosphate \cite{Kochanowski2013a}.
	ArcA is part of a two component system (ArcAB) which controls gene expression in response to aerobic versus anaerobic conditions \cite{Keseler2017, Alvarez2010}.
	Metabolites are displayed in larger font, enzymes that catalyze reactions in smaller fonts.
	In the colored boxes, regulation by CRP is displayed by an oval symbol marked "CRP".
	Similarly, when an enzyme is regulated by Cra or ArcA this is displayed next to the boxes; a plus or minus symbol indicates positive or negative regulation.
	Additionaly, in the boxes this diagram displays the concentration of particular enzymes in ppm, as annotated in PaxDb (retrieved in 2015) \cite{Wang2015}.
	The boxes are also color-coded according to abundance of the enzymes.
	The diagram is based on EcoCyc \cite{Keseler2017}. 
	From top to bottom, clockwise, enzymes abbreviations stand for glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-biphosphate, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, 1,3-biphospho-D-glycerate, 3-phospho-glycerate, 2-phospho-glycerate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, acetyl coenzyme A, citrate, cis-aconitate, d-threo-isocitrate, (succinate, glyoxalate, acetyl-CoA), 2-oxo-glutarate, succinyl-CoA, succinate, fumarate, malate, oxaloacetate.

        exponential phase growth rates of $\Delta$cAMP cells at different concentrations of cAMP as measured in a platereader that measured bacterial density over time.
        %
        The growth rate was determined by an exponential fit, based on a manually selected part of the bacterial density curve that displayed exponential growth.

        We also used an alternative method to determine growth rates (gray dashed line), were we 
        fitted an exponential to part of the bacterial density curve that fell between two threshold values.
        We consider this less reliable, as growth is not guaranteed to be exponential.
        %
        We also show the optimum curve as measured by Towbin et al \cite{Towbin2017} (dashed blue line),
        who calculated growth rate based on an exponential fit to a two hour window,
        which was selected by an algorithm that looked for the longest period of stable growth rate.

        \textbf{The reporters used in this study.}
        (Top left panel) This panel shows the lac operon, on which these promoters are based.
        The lac operon consists of three genes, \textit{lacZ}, \textit{lacY} and \textit{lacA}, that are required to metabolize lactose.
        These three genes are regulated by the same promoter, which is activated by CRP. 
        When there is no lactose, transcriptional repressor lacI blocks gene expression from the lac operon.
        The \textit{lacI} gene is encoded at a location near to the lac operon, and is also displayed (it is also regulated by CRP).
        When there is lactose, transcriptional repressor lacI is inhibited by lactose and LacZ, LacY and LacA are produced.
        CRP recruits initiation factor sigma 70, which is followed by polymerase binding and transcription.
        (It is furthermore also known that pleiotropic transcription factor H-NS can bind to the lac operon and repress gene expression.)
        (Top right and bottom left panel) Using the lac promoter as a starting point, Towbin et al. created two reporters \cite{Towbin2017}.
        Both posses mutations which result in the removal of the LacI binding site (indicated with a black cross).
        The CRP sensitive promoter is then created by fusing the promoter to a GFP fluorescent protein sequence.
        We call this the CRP reporter or metabolic reporter.
        In the promoter of the second reporter, which is intented to measure background fluctuations in gene expression, also mutations have been introduced that remove the CRP binding site. Instead, a consensus binding site for the sigma 70 initiation factor is introduced, effectively making it a constitutive promoter that is otherwise similar to the promoter used for the CRP reporter. It was also fused to GFP, and we call this the sigma 70 reporter or constitutive reporter.
        (Bottom right panel) To be able to perform single cell measurements that involve both reporters, we replaced the GFP sequences of the metabolic and constitutive reporters with mVenus and mCerulean sequences respectively. 
        The GFP reporters were introduced to cells using plasmids as vector,
        whilst the mVenus and mCerulean reporters were chromosomally inserted at the \textit{intC} and \textit{galK} locations respectively.

		\textbf{Time evolution of production versus growth rate during block pulses of high and low cAMP concentrations.}
		(Top) The production rate of the CRP reporter plotted against growth rate, color coded for time. Production is determined here by the difference in absolute signal between two timepoints, divided by the amount of time inbetween these two points and divided by the area of the cell. Note that the production rate might also depends on the growth rate, as does the final concentration of the protein. This makes this data not trivial to interpret.

	\textbf{Constitutive production-growth cross-correlations $R_{p_Q,\mu}(\tau)$ per experiment.}
This figure is similar to figure \ref{fig:CRP:CCRdCy}, except that it relates to constitutive reporter measurements.
These graphs shows cross-correlations (CCs) per condition, per experiment. 
It displays not only the overall cross-correlation (black), but also the cross-correlation based on the scatter plots (red) and the control (gray area); see chapter \ref{chapter:methods} and also figure \ref{fig:mm:exampleCC}, for more information.
The error bars in the black curves are SEM, based on dividing data from a single experiment into four groups, and calculating four CCs, for which the SEM is calculated.
The black CCs here correspond to the shaded CCs that are shown in other figures where multiple experiments are combined into one plot.

		\textbf{Exploratory experiments with plasmid reporters show similar results as experiments with our chromosomal reporters.}
		The interaction of metabolic and growth fluctuations was also measured by plasmid constructs in initial experiments, where the metabolic reporter and constitutive reporter were put into different cell lines on similar plasmids with a GFP reporter. 
		The plasmids on which these cross-correlations are based are the same as described in ref \cite{Towbin2017}.
		Except for the fact that the reporters are on plasmids instead of chromosomally inserted, and both placed in separate cell lines instead of the same cell line, the experimental conditions are exactly the same as in the experiments presented earlier involving wild type and $\Delta$cAMP cells plus 800 $\upmu$M cAMP (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}).
		Consistently, in this supplemental figure, we observe slightly different but qualitatively similar cross-correlations as in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.
		The constitutive reporter (top right for wild type cells and bottom right for $\Delta$cAMP cells plus 800 $\upmu$M cAMP) shows cross-correlations that are most similar to a dilution scenario, 
		and as before (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}), the metabolic reporter in wild type cells shows a similar behavior.
		On the other hand, without feedback, the metabolic reporter shows very different behavior in the $\Delta$cAMP cells plus 800 $\upmu$M cAMP.
		As before, black lines correspond to production rate-growth cross-correlations, and colored lines to concentration-growth cross-correlations.
		Darker lines are averages of multiple experiments, the shaded lines show the separate experiments (when more than 1 experiment was conducted).
