\subsection*{Environmental and stochastic input to regulatory networks}

The world is unpredictable.
%
A bacterial cell observes both its extracellular environment and its intracellular environment,
and adjusts its gene expression to 
optimize its chances of survival in this world.
%
%To survive bacteria need to respond to unforeseen situations and express the right gene at the right time. 
% Expressing the right gene at the right time is vital for bacterial survival. 
%Cells rely on biochemical networks to control gene expression.
%(Biochemical network is a general term that refers to the chemical interactions between proteins and small molecular mechanisms.)
To control gene expression a bacterium --- like any other cell --- relies on chemical interactions between proteins and small molecules \cite{Bray1995, Alon2006, Alon2007, Tyson2010}.
%A bacterium, like any other cell, relies on chemical interactions between proteins and small molecules to control gene expression \cite{Bray1995, Alon2006, Alon2007, Tyson2010}.

%dynamics.
%
%On one hand, the extracellular environment might change, and a different gene expression profile is required.
Changes in the extracellular environment might require the cell to adjust gene expression accordingly.
%
On the other hand,  even without environmental changes, the stochastic nature of chemical reactions can lead to fluctuations of proteins and metabolites over time within the cell \cite{Elowitz2002,Kiviet2014}.
The architecture of the biochemical network might enable the cell to deal with these fluctuations, or even use them to its advantage (see also chapter \ref{chapter:literaturereview}).
%
%Studies often focus on how the biochemical network is designed to deal with either one or the other of these two types of dynamics.

%\subsection*{The metabolic regulator CRP recieves both stochastic and environmental input}
\subsection*{Stochastic and environmental input in a model system: CRP}

To investigate this question, we look at the regulation of metabolic enzyme expression by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP).
%
Activated CRP stimulates metabolic enzyme expression, but CRP is inhibited by the metabolites that are produced by these enzymes \cite{You2013}.
%
It was recently discovered that when cells are grown in environments with different sugar sources, 
%on different sugar sources, 
this sensing of the metabolite concentrations by negative feedback 
is the regulatory interaction which
allows cells to express the appropriate amount of enzymes for most sugar sources \cite{Towbin2017}.
%
However, when a population of cells is growing in a constant environment with a constant carbon source,
%However, when the cell is growing steadily on a single carbon source for an extended period of time, 
there is still a large heterogeneity observed in growth rates and metabolic enzyme expression levels \cite{Kiviet2014} (see also chapter \ref{chapter:literaturereview}).
%
%Observations by Kiviet et al. suggest that single cell stochastic fluctuations in enzyme levels result in changes in metabolite fluxes, and eventually fluctuations in growth rate \cite{Kiviet2014}.
Observations by Kiviet et al. suggest that single cell enzyme concentrations fluctuate stochastically over time, which in turn results in fluctuations in metabolite fluxes and eventually in growth rate \cite{Kiviet2014}.
%
Thus, single cell metabolite concentrations might fluctuate over time due to stochastic fluctuations .
%This observation also implies that there might be large fluctuations in the pool of metabolites available to the cell.
That would imply that also the CRP system receives a large variation of inputs in single cells, even when there are no changes in the extracellular environment.
%
%In other words: though the mean CRP activity might be set by the external environment, single cells might have wholly different CRP activities due to stochastic fluctuations.
%
We here set out to investigate whether the CRP system indeed experiences and acts on these different stochastic inputs.

\subsection*{The CRP system}

Before turning to how we manipulate and measure the dynamics of the CRP system, 
% and perform measurements on it, 
we would also like to provide some context on this considerably researched system \cite{Keseler2017, Fic2009, Deutscher2008, Gorke2008}.
%
%To investigate this question, we take a closer look at the dynamics of regulation by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP; previously called catabolite gene activator protein, or CAP). 
%To investigate this question we looked at a master regulator of metabolic enzyme expression in \textit{Escherichia coli}.
%
CRP might be called a master regulator of metabolic enzyme expression in \textit{Escherichia coli}\footnote{CRP was previously called catabolite gene activator protein, or CAP.}, since
%
it is thought to % that CRP 
control the expression level of all catabolic genes in concert \cite{You2013, Hui2015, Kochanowski2017}.
%
Catabolic enzymes 
are of major importance to the cell, 
as they
convert large carbohydrate molecules into smaller metabolites, and generate energy for the cell during this process in the form of ATP \cite{Nelson2005}.
%
CRP controls 378 promoters, among which 70 transcription factors \cite{Green2014, Shimada2011, Grainger2005, Zheng2004}.
%
Amidst these targets are also all enzymes in the TCA cycle, see also figure \ref{fig:CRP:figOverviewTCARegulation}.
%
CRP is allosterically activated by the small signaling molecule cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), 
which is produced from ATP by the enzyme adenylate cyclase (CyaA).
%
The cell can also control cAMP concentration by active degradation, 
which is catalyzed by the 
% An important other way by which the cell controls the cAMP concentrations is active degradation by the 
cAMP phosphodiesterase (CpdA) enzyme\footnote{It is sometimes mentioned in literature that cAMP is also actively exported from the cell by the membrance channel protein TolC, but the primary publication that made this claim has been retracted \cite{Hantke2011}.}.
%
cAMP production by adenylate cyclase is thought to be inhibited by $\upalpha$-ketoacids, such as oxaloacetate (OAA), $\upalpha$-ketoglutarate ($\upalpha$-KG) and pyruvate (PYR) \cite{You2013}.
(Previously, also the phosphorylated enzyme IIA of the phosphotransferase system was thought to activate adenylate cyclase \cite{Keseler2017, Deutscher2008, Gorke2008}, but it has now been suggested that the role of $\upalpha$-ketoacids feedback is bigger \cite{You2013}.)
%
Thus, the CRP-cAMP regulation is wired such that metabolites from the TCA cycle and glycolysis pathway provide negative feedback on metabolic enzyme expression, see also figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig0}.A. 
%
As mentioned, 
it is thought that this negative feedback in the CRP regulatory system
is responsible for adjusting the concentration of metabolic enzymes in the cell to handle the carbohydrate nutrient source available to the cell appropriately \cite{Towbin2017}.
%
%More specifically, to maximize growth rate, the cell needs to properly allocate its protein pool among different generic activities such as catabolism, anabolism, protein production, and replication of DNA \cite{Hui2015}.
%The negative feedback loop is thought to enable the cell to estimate what the best concentration of metabolic enzymes is under most conditions
%and set enzyme expression accordingly \cite{Towbin2017}, see also figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig0}.A.


\subsection*{CRP with and without processing stochastic input}

To find out whether the CRP system responds to stochastic input we needed to decouple the responses to stochastic and environmental inputs.
%To address this question we need to be able to decouple the responses to these two different inputs.
%
To this end, we employed two strains that had the appropriate mean CRP activity for the sugar source they were grown on, 
but where in one strain the feedback loop could not respond to stochastic input it might receive.
%
The two strains we used are a wild type MG1655, and a \textit{cyaA}, \textit{cpda} null mutant \cite{Towbin2017}.
As mentioned, \textit{cyaA} enables cAMP production and \textit{cpda} cAMP degradation, 
% note $\Delta$ is upright by default
%
which means that the \textit{cyaA}, \textit{cpda} null mutant was unable to modify its cAMP levels, and had a crippled feedback loop that could not respond to both environmental and stochastic input signals.
%
%This means these cells cannot use their feedback regulation to determine the correct mean CRP activity they should have in their environment. 
%
To repair this strain's ability to express the right amount of metabolic enzymes with regard to their environment, 
we provided cAMP extracellularly in the cells' growth medium.
%
This bypassed the feedback loop and directly set the correct CRP activity for the sugar they were grown on \cite{Towbin2017},
but left the feedback loop unable to respond to stochastic input signals, see also figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig0}.B.
%
This experimental design allowed us to compare a cell that has the correct mean CRP activity and \textit{could} respond to stochastic input signals, 
with a cell that had the correct mean CRP activity but \textit{could not} respond to stochastic input signals.
%
We then used single cell time lapse microscopy and fluorescent labeling to determine single cell growth and CRP dynamics. 
%
We first used these single cell technique to see whether the CRP system could respond on timescales at which the stochastic fluctuations take place.
%
Secondly, we used cross-correlation analyses to quantify the dynamical growth and CRP behavior of the two strains described above.
%
This showed that the CRP system can indeed operate on timescales that are comparable to time scales of stochastic fluctuations, and moreover that
the dynamics of metabolism and growth change remarkably when its regulation is not able to respond to stochastic inputs.
%
These observations suggested that regulatory interactions also respond to stochastic inputs.
%
This implied in turn that our notion of steady state behavior should be updated, 
as the cellular state might be constantly changing in a way that is facilitated by regulatory interactions.

\section*{Results}

\subsection*{The CRP system is able to respond to dynamic signals}

Our hypothesis is that stochastic fluctuations in metabolic enzyme concentration result in metabolite concentration changes, which in turn lead to a response by the CRP system.
%
We first wanted to see whether the CRP system was at all capable of responding to a quickly changing input signal, such as stochastic fluctuations might generate.
% To test this hypothesis, we first subjected the CRP system to artificial cAMP fluctuations to see whether it can respond to such quick fluctuations.
%
%However, the time scales at which these stochastic fluctuations occur might be too fast 
%for the CRP regulatory system to respond.
%To test the response time of the CRP system, we subjected cells to quickly alternating low and high cAMP concentrations in our flow cell.
%
In this paragraph we show that the CRP system indeed responds considerably at rapid timescales to changes in the cAMP signal it receives.


To probe the response of the CRP system to a quickly changing signal, 
%we subjected 
we used
our \textit{cyaA}, \textit{cpda} null mutant strain that does not respond to intracellular metabolic feedback (we will refer to this strain as $\Delta$cAMP from hereon for convenience).
Instead of the intracellular signal, we provided it with an artificial cAMP signal by providing high (2100$\upmu$m) or low (43$\upmu$m) concentrations of cAMP in the cellular growth medium.
%
Additionally, 
to assess the response of the CRP system we equipped these cells with a chromosomally inserted reporter construct that reads out the expression level of metabolic enzymes \cite{Towbin2017}.
% with a chromosomally inserted copy of this reporter construct
%which carried a chromosomal insertion with this reporter, 
%to a regime of alternating high and low cAMP concentrations.
%under the microscope whilst alternating between high and low cAMP concentrations.
%
%To be able to assess the response of the CRP system, we needed to measure its output.
%To be able to do this, we used a reporter construct that reads out the expression level of metabolic enzymes \cite{Towbin2017}.
%
%
This reporter construct uses the lac operon promoter from which the lacI binding site has been removed, see figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig0sup}.
The promoter is fused to a fluorescent reporter protein (either gfpmut2 or mVenus, depending on the experiment) which allowed us to
%estimate 
assess
the expression level of metabolic enzymes as induced by CRP.
%
%
%
%
We grew these cells in our microfluidic device (see methods section and chapter \ref{chapter:methods}) under the microscope, and 
first alternated between high and low concentrations of cAMP at 1hr intervals, and then alternated between the same concentrations at 5hr intervals.
%
Figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1}.A shows how the concentration of metabolic reporter responded to the quickly changing cAMP signal. 
%
During fast switches (1 hours) the signal went up and down substantially, consistent with respectively the high and low cAMP signal supplied, with a minimum of 215 a.u. and a maximum of 258 a.u..
%
During slow switches (5 hours) it became apparent that the signal did not reach an equilibrium value during the fast switching behavior, as the metabolic reporter reached a lower and higher minimum and maximum respectively at 144 a.u. and 407 a.u.. 
%
Importantly, the behavior in the regime with fast switches suggested that the concentrations of metabolic enzymes under the control of a CRP promoter can respond quickly and substantially in response to a varying input signal. 
 


This led to our next question: what is the effect of these changes in metabolic enzyme concentration on the cell? 
%
To gauge this, we looked at how cellular growth rate responded to the fluctuations in cAMP signal. 
%
Figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1}.B shows that also the growth rate varied substantially, again suggesting the cell is susceptible to fluctuations in regulatory molecules. 
%
However, the growth rate behavior showed some puzzling features. 
%
Firstly, it appeared that in the fast switch regime the high cAMP concentration immediately results in a sustained faster growth rate.
This is unexpected, as too much metabolic enzyme expression is expected to come with the cost of superfluous protein production, and might even lead to a detrimental unbalanced ratio of fluxes in the cell \cite{Ray2016}.
%
However, when looking at the slower switch regime we see that this signal also goes down after while. 
%
We can explain this seemingly erratic behavior by plotting a time trace of the growth rate against the concentration of metabolic reporter.
%
This trace is shown in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig1}.C. 
%
The most left green square in this figure indicates a switch to a low cAMP concentration, and the part of the time trace that starts at this square shows that as the metabolic reporter concentration goes down, the growth rate first goes up, and then comes down again. 
This is consistent with the idea that metabolic enzyme concentration has an optimal value above and below which the cell grows worse \cite{Jensen1993, Dekel2005, Berkhout2013, Ray2016, Towbin2017}.
%earlier observations which show that the relationship between growth rate and metabolic enzyme concentration shows an optimum concentration above and below which the cell grows worse.
%
The idea of an optimum metabolic enzyme concentration is also confirmed when we plot growth rate against the metabolic reporter concentration, as shown in supplemental figure \ref{fig:CRP:scatterspulsing}. 
%
Conversely, looking at the part of the trace that starts at the leftmost red square, the reporter concentration appears not to be affected, but the growth rate does go up.
%
The rest of the trace is then consistent with traversing on the right part of an optimum curve.
%
An explanation for this part of the trace not overlapping with the earlier discussed part of the trace, and the quick growth rate response without concentration change, 
could be that cAMP also has some post-translational roles in the cell. 
This would explain the quick responses both in the fast-switching regime and the quick response to an upshift of cAMP.


If there were a post-translational role for cAMP, then the concentration of cAMP should show a more consistent relation with growth rate than the concentration of metabolic reporter.
%
%The concentration of CRP.cAMP should be proportional with the cAMP concentration, and so should the production of our metabolic reporter.
The production rate of our metabolic reporter should be proportional to the cAMP concentration, 
so the metabolic reporter production rate could serve as a proxy for cAMP concentration.
%
However, this production rate also depends on the growth rate of the cell, and might do so in a non-trivial manner.
Indeed, it is difficult to find a straightforward explanation for the relationship between production and growth over time, as shown in supplemental figure \ref{fig:CRP:productiontimeevolutions}.
Only when the metabolic production is normalized against a second reporter with a constitutive promoter (see figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig0}.B) as a reference, do we see that most traces overlap.
%
(Such a normalization could also be done for the concentration, which appears to make the traces slightly more reproducible, but not substantially different.)
%
The larger overlap in the normalized production vs growth time trace (compared to the concentration of metabolic reporter vs. growth) offers some support for a post-translational role of cAMP.
%
In \ecoli however, cAMP is usually described as an activator of the translational regulator CRP protein only \cite{gorke2008, keseler2017}.

Nevertheless, the observations made in this pulsing experiment show that the CRP system can respond to quickly fluctuating input signals, as also might occur due to stochastic fluctuations.

%\subsection*{Probing CRP dynamics in a constant environment}
\subsection*{The effect of stochastic fluctuations on CRP regulation}

\subsubsection*{The feedback loop affects population dynamics}

Thus, given that the CRP system seems sensitive to quickly changing input, we wanted to further probe how cells growing in a constant environment respond to intracellular stochastic fluctuations.
%
%Since we suspected that CRP regulation might both respond to environmental and intracellular fluctuations, 
%
We wanted to isolate and/or manipulate the regulatory response to these fluctuations.
%In order to study the response of the regulatory system to stochastic fluctuations, we needed to isolate the regulatory response to those fluctuations.
%
%Indeed, 
We managed to remove any potential response of the regulatory system to stochastic fluctuations, while maintaining the mean expression level 
required in the cellular environment.
%required as response to the environment.
%
This was done by growing our $\Delta$cAMP strain on minimum medium supplemented with lactose and 800 $\upmu$M cAMP.
%
This concentration of cAMP resulted in growth rates that are comparable to those observed in wild type cells growing on lactose (see also supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:overviewsummaryparams}).
On the other hand, the cAMP levels in these cells were fixed and thus unable to respond to intracellular metabolite concentrations.
%
Using our metabolic reporter construct, we were able to assess the CRP dynamics in these cells.
We compared CRP expression dynamics in these cells without feedback against wild type cells (which also carried the metabolic reporter and were also growing on lactose).
%
This thus gave us a way to decouple the regulatory response to stochastic intracellular changes from the regulatory response to environmental changes,
and study whether there is indeed regulatory activity in response to stochastic changes.

%We first investigated the metabolic dynamics in the wild type setting.
%
The left panel in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2}.A shows a scatter plot that relates the concentration of metabolic reporter to the growth rate for a single cell experiment with wild type cells.
%
%As expected, individual cells that have a higher metabolic enzyme expression show a lower growth rate.
%
%However, d
The scatter cloud appears to lay on a straight line with a negative slope.
%
Conversely, the green cloud in the right panel in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2}.A shows
% the relationship between metabolic regulation and growth observed in cells 
the growth-expression relationship observed in cells 
that lack the ability to respond to stochastically fluctuating metabolite concentrations, ie. our $\Delta$cAMP cells growing in 800 $\upmu$M cAMP lacking negative feedback regulation.
%
Remarkably, the cells without feedback do not show a similarly negatively sloped relationship between metabolic expression and growth rate.
%
%This indicates that the dynamics of wild type cells is influenced by stochastic influences from inside the cell.
This indicates that the CRP regulatory interactions play a role in shaping stochastic fluctuations in the cell. 
%
To make sure  
%this behavior 
the changes 
were not due to generic changes in cellular dynamics, we made use of a second reporter construct.
%
This construct carried a similar promoter to the metabolic promoter, but it contained mutations that removed the CRP binding site and introduced a $\upsigma$70 consensus binding site instead \cite{Towbin2017} (see also methods).
%
%The idea is that the resulting constitutive promoter fused to a fluorescent mCerulean reporter shows the generic dynamics that exist in protein production in the cell.
This resulted in a constitutive promoter, which was then fused to a fluorescent mCerulean reporter.
%
The aim of this construct was to report specifically for the generic dynamics of protein production due to cellular state changes (i.e. intrinsic noise)
which might also be experienced by the CRP reporter ---
%
%which result from stochastic cellular state changes,
%and growth rate fluctuations, 
%usually referred to as extrinsic noise
% --- but not for due to CRP regulation.
but to exclude the effects of CRP regulation.
%
Figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2}.B shows that the expression-growth relationship of this constitutive reporter does not change between cells with or without feedback (blue and green clouds).
This confirms the attribution of the change in dynamics observed in \ref{fig:CRP:fig2}.A to the CRP regulation responding to stochastically fluctuating metabolite concentrations.

\subsubsection*{The not so average cell}

Our "feedbackless" $\Delta$cAMP cells allowed us to investigate a second question:
how do the stochastic deviations \textit{from} mean behavior relate to the mean behavior itself?
%
To further probe the behavior of cellular populations, we exposed our $\Delta$cAMP cells to two additional conditions: 
%
%To further investigate the behavior of cells , we exposed our $\Delta$cAMP cells to two additional constant conditions:
respectively 80 or 5000 $\upmu$M cAMP (further conditions were equal to the earlier experiments).
%
The behavior of cells on the level of population averages is reasonably straightforward to understand.
%
As we show in supplementary note I at the end of this chapter, the steady state relationships between the protein expression and growth are determined by three ingredients:
(1) the interaction between protein production and dilution, (2) the concave relationship between metabolic enzyme expression and growth which suggests there is an optimal level of metabolic enzyme expression and (3) the observation that an increase in metabolic protein expression leads to a mandatory equal decrease in constitutive protein expression and vice versa.
%
However, neither the wild type (blue) or $\Delta$cAMP (green) scatter clouds in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2} seem to adhere to the concave relationship:
%
the wild type cells simply show a negative relationship between CRP concentration and growth rate, whilst the feedbackless cells lay on a line of constant growth rate.
%
The population averages of the $\Delta$cAMP cells obtained from the additional experiments at  80 or 5000 $\upmu$M cAMP follow the previously observed concave curve \cite{Towbin2017}, 
but the single cell datapoints (visualized by the red and orange clouds respectively in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2}.A) do not seem to lay on a continuous concave curve.
%showed population average values that follow the same concave curve as observed earlier (supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:scatterspulsing} and \cite{Towbin2017}).
%
%The clouds roughly follow this behavior, but seem to deviate.
%
This deviation from the average behavior is much more pronounced in the concentration-growth relationship of the constitutive reporter.
The population average behavior of the constitutive reporter growth rates is expected to show a concave relationship with reporter concentration (supplementary notes) similar to the metabolic reporter,
but the single cell data does not follow this relationship at all, see figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2}.B. 
%
% Despite the trend observed in the average growth-expression relationship, which showed a concave cAMP-growth curve with an optimum metabolic expression (supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:scatterspulsing} and \cite{Towbin2017}), we found that the shape of this cloud appears to follow a straight line with a negative slope.
%On one hand, the average concentration seems consistent with ideas about cellular resource allocation \cite{You2013}: cells that are forced to produce more metabolic proteins, automatically produce less other proteins such as the constitutive reporter. This relationship between the average concentrations of the metabolic and constitutive reporters is also directly visualized in the top right panel of supplemental figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3scatters_CC_pp}.
%
%However, the clouds in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2}.B on the other hand, which show the deviations of single cells from the average cell, do not follow this average behavior at all.

\subsubsection*{Average relations do not predict dynamic relations and CRP regulation responds to stochastic inputs}
%\subsubsection*{Deviations from average behavior and CRP regulation responds to stochastic inputs}

Taken together, these observations suggest that the dynamical behavior of single cells
%that deviate from the average cell, 
does not necessarily follow relationships that exist for average quantities over different conditions. More importantly, the fact that cells that are unable to respond to internal metabolite fluctuations show substantially different behavior from those that can, indicates that the CRP regulation network is actively responding to inputs when the cell resides in a constant environment.
%
To further understand the shape of the single cell data point clouds, we turn to cross-correlation analyses in the next paragraph.

\subsection*{Understanding the CRP response to stochastic fluctuations}

We want to understand the effect of fluctuations in cellular parameters on regulatory interactions and other parameters (such as growth) at the single cell level.
%
To understand these dynamic relationships time is an important component.
%To understand how parameters dynamically relate to each other in the stochastic cellular environment, time is an important component.
%
%It has for example been shown by using cross-correlations that certain enzyme's single cell production rates have a delayed effect on single cell growth rates \cite{Kiviet2014}.
%
In this paragraph we dissect the time dynamics with cross-correlations
%use cross-correlations 
to show that metabolic fluctuations would transfer to cellular growth rate if it were not for the existence of the negative feedback CRP regulation.

%\subsubsection*{Cross-correlations reveal major metabolic changes due to removal of feedback regulation}
\subsubsection*{Cross-correlations reveal major changes due to removal of feedback}

%We here also employ cross-correlations to investigate the delayed correlations between our metabolic, constitutive and growth parameters.
%
We start by investigating the effect that single cell metabolic concentration fluctuations have on growth rates.
%
We use the 
cross-correlation $R_{M,\mu}(\tau)$ to show us the relation between the metabolic reporter $M$ concentration and past and future growth rates $\mu$.
%
More precisely, as explained in chapter \ref{chapter:methods}, the cross-correlation $R_{M,\mu}(\tau)$ calculates the average correlation between $M$ at time $t$ with $\mu$ at time $t+\tau$.
%
The colored lines in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.A-B show the cross-correlation $R_{M,\mu}(\tau)$ for wild type (green) and feedbackless $\Delta$cAMP cells (blue).
%between the metabolic reporter concentration $M$ and growth rate $\mu$ based on single cell observations.
%
%As explained in \red{XXADDREFXX}, the cross-correlation $R_{x,y}(\tau)$ calculates the correlation between a parameter $x$ at time $t$ with parameter $y$ at time $t+\tau$; thus 
%correlations between $x$ and future or past values of $y$ become apparent.
%
From these curves it is immediately apparent that the dynamic metabolic concentration-growth relationship is very different between cells 
that possess the endogenous CRP feedback and those that do not.
%
Firstly, as expected, the $R$ values at $\tau=0$ --- which reflect the correlation in the scatter plots shown in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2} --- are different.
But secondly and more importantly, 
%
%Not only is the difference between correlations in wild type and $\Delta$cAMP cells that was also observed earlier in the scatter plots apparent from the values at delay $\tau=0$,
it becomes apparent that the concentration-growth relationship of the wild type cells shows a strong negative correlation at negative delays, 
whilst the $\Delta$cAMP cells show a relationship that is positive for most delays and that is rather symmetric around the y-axis, or perhaps even has slightly more positive weight at positive $\tau$ values.
% than at negative $\tau$ values.
%
%Not only is the correlation that was observed earlier in the scatter plots apparent from the value at delay $\tau=0$, the concentration-growth relationship also shows a strong negative correlation at negative delays, whilst for the .
%
Previous studies showed that investigating the relationship between protein production rates and growth rates (in addition to to protein concentrations and growth rates) can give further insights in the dynamics of metabolism and growth \cite{Kiviet2014}.
%
Hence, we here also calculated the production rate $p$ of our reporters.
%
The scatter plots for these relationships are shown in supplemental figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2sup}.
%
Note that it is convenient to place these scatter plots in the context of the expected population average relationships (figure \ref{fig:CRP:averagerelations2}), 
since these reveal that this relationship can be described by an algebraic curve, 
which can map a production rate to two values.
%a specific production rates can map to two growth rate values.
% on the algebraic curves.
%
When we use the metabolic production rates $p_M$ to calculate $R_{p_M,\mu}$ cross-correlations, we see a similar difference between wild type cells and $\Delta$cAMP cells as in the $R_{M,\mu}$ curves:
the wild type cells show more correlation on the left side of the y-axis (albeit slightly positive correlations), whilst the $\Delta$cAMP cells show more correlation on the right side of the y-axis.
%
As with the scatter plots, we wanted to check whether these changes in cellular behavior are specific to CRP regulation,
or reflect some general change in the cellular state.
%
To this end, we generated cross-correlations $R_{Q,\mu}$ and $R_{p_Q,\mu}$, which correlate the concentration $Q$ and production $p_Q$ of the constitutive reporter $Q$ with growth $\mu$.
%
These curves are plotted in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.C-D and we can make two observations from them.
Firstly, the curves for the wild type and $\Delta$cAMP cells are highly similar.
%
This indicates that the constitutive reporter has similar dynamics both in wild type cells as in $\Delta$cAMP cells.
%
This is consistent with our hypothesis that specifically the interaction between growth and metabolism changes due to the absence of the CRP negative feedback loop, 
but not other dynamics such as constitutive expression - growth dynamics.
%
% which in turn 
This is in turn consistent with the idea that the feedback loop is performing an active role in the wild type cells in response to stochastic signals.
%
Secondly, the constitutive reporter dynamics as shown by the $R(\tau)$ curves (figures \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.C-D) appear very similar to the dynamics of metabolism and growth in the wild type cells (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.A).
%
%To further interpret this similarity and the curves themselves, we turn to a minimal model of the cell.
These observations also highlight that the dynamic interactions between cellular parameters go beyond instantaneous relationships that are captured by scatter plots, but instead show richer interactions that act over delays. 
To further interpret these relationships we turn to a minimal model of the cell.

\subsubsection*{A minimal model helps to interpret the cross-correlations}

In the following sections we present a model that suggests the experimental data is consistent with the hypothesis 
that without feedback, metabolism-growth dynamics would be dominated by fluctuations that originate in metabolic protein production and metabolism itself,
but that with feedback, the transmission of these fluctuations is suppressed.

%In the following sections we present a model that suggests that 
%without feedback, metabolism-growth dynamics would be 
%%
%%In this section we present a model that gives an interpretation 
%%This section gives an interpretation 
%%as to why the measured cross-correlation curves (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}) look the way they do.
%%
%%The model suggests that 
%metabolism-growth dynamics in wild type cells 
%%and any constitutive expression-growth dynamics
%are not influenced by CRP-controlled expression fluctuations, 
%%dominated by non-metabolism related fluctuations, 
%whereas without feedback, the $\Delta$cAMP cells' metabolism-growth dynamics are dominated by CRP-controlled enzyme fluctuations.

%The dynamic interaction between enzyme expression and growth (or in general, protein expression and growth) can be modeled using a system of coupled differential equations.
%
To establish our model, we drew on previous models by Dunlop et al. \cite{Dunlop2008}, Kiviet et al. \cite{Kiviet2014} and Towbin et al. \cite{Towbin2017}.
%We draw here on previous models \cite{Dunlop2008, Kiviet2014, Towbin2017}.
%
The Kiviet et al. model used coupled stochastic linear differential equations to elucidate the the dynamics between growth $\mu$, enzyme production $p$ and enzyme concentration $C$. % \cite{Kiviet2014}.
%
We also use these parameters, and --- based on Towbin et al. --- we additionally use the parameter $x$ to represent the metabolite concentration. 
%We added 
%%an element 
%a parameter 
%from the Towbin et al. model to this, 
%%Additionally, we drew an element from the Towbin et al. model, and 
%%and extended our model 
%%by
%and also explicitly modeled the metabolite concentration $x$. %, also described by a separate differential equation.
%
%Furthermore, i
In our adapted model we 
%We adapted their model and explicitly 
model each of these four parameters by its own differential equation.
%
Similar to the Kiviet model, the influence of any parameter $X$ on any other parameter $Y$ is mathematically modeled by coupling coefficients $T_{{Y}\leftarrow{X}}$, such that 
\begin{align*}
	\dot{Y} = (..) + T_{{Y}\leftarrow{X}} \cdot X
	.
\end{align*}
%
Furthermore, also like Kiviet et al. we added terms that introduced noise into the system, as well as dampening terms, to allow us to introduce stochastic fluctuations into our model.
Using such coupling terms and noise sources, 
we created a model for the parameters $\mu$, $p$, $C$ and $x$ that we think represents the biology of the cell, 
%our model is wired in a way that we think represents the biology of the cell,
see figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig4}.A.
%
%The %use of an 
%explicitly modeled metabolite $x$ allowed for a 
%more
In this model, the parameter $x$ allowed for a
concrete interpretation of metabolic dynamics,
as growth $\mu$ and production of proteins $p$ can be influenced by the metabolite concentration $x$ (trough transmission coefficients $T_{{\mu}\leftarrow{x}}$ and $T_{{\mu}\leftarrow{x}}$ respectively).
%
In turn, the protein concentration is set by production rate $p$ and dilution rate $\mu$, i.e. 
\begin{align*}
\dot{C} = p - \mu C
.
\end{align*}
When a protein is enzymatically active, protein concentration fluctuations might influence the metabolite concentration $x$ through transmission coefficient $T_{{x}\leftarrow{C}}$.
%
% MAYBE WE WANT TO SAY THIS ALL THE WAY IN THE END FOR THE AHA-ERLEBNIS?
%Interestingly, this model can also allow for a simple interpretation of the feedback, 
Finally, this model also allows for a conveniently simple interpretation of the metabolite feedback onto the CRP regulation:
%which
it might be implemented as a negative contribution to the transmission coefficient $T_{{p}\leftarrow{x}}$.
%The feedback provided by metabolites onto the protein production rate could be implemented as a negative contribution to the transmission coefficient  $T_{{p}\leftarrow{x}}$.
%
We propagated this model numerically to simulate different scenarios, which we can use as reference to understand our experimental data.

%For a more detailed discussion about this model, 
See supplementary note II for a more detailed description of the model.

%\subsubsection*{Connecting experimental cross-correlations to model dynamics}
\subsubsection*{The model connects experimental cross-correlations to types of dynamics}

Previously, three biologically relevant scenarios of how fluctuations transmit from one parameter to the next were presented \cite{Kiviet2014}.
%
%Our extended model can reproduce these scenarios, 
We first used our model to reproduce these scenarios,
which are the dilution mode, the catabolic mode and the common mode.
%
The model simulated for each scenario the dynamics between our experimentally measured observables, $p$, $C$ and $\mu$,
and predicted the appearance of the associated cross-correlations %behavior of the 
 $R_{C,\mu}(\tau)$ and $R_{p,\mu}(\tau)$, which can be measured experimentally. % cross-correlations associated with each scenario.
%
In the first scenario, called the dilution scenario, 
%Firstly, in the dilution scenario, 
fluctuations starting outside the metabolism that affect growth are the largest. 
This  leads to dynamics in which dilution by volume growth dominates the cross-correlations.
Fluctuations in growth rate are thus followed by negatively correlated fluctuations in concentration, as expressed by the negative values of $R_{C,\mu}(\tau)$ at negative $\tau$ values.
Since volume growth does not interact with protein production, the correlation between our other pair of observables $p$ and $\mu$ was found to be zero for all $\tau$ values.
Both the $R_{C,\mu}(\tau)$ cross-correlations and the $R_{p,\mu}(\tau)$ cross-correlation for the dilution scenario are shown in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig4}.B.
%
In the second scenario, the catabolic scenario,
%Secondly, in the catabolic scenario, 
fluctuations in $p$ dominate the system, and are propagated via $C$ and $x$ to $\mu$.
This led to  positive values of $R_{C,\mu}(\tau)$ and $R_{p,\mu}(\tau)$ at positive $\tau$ values, 
%Cross-correlations for this scenario are 
as shown in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig4}.C.
Such a mode implies that concentration fluctuations can have cell-wide consequences, even affecting the growth rate of the cell.
%Such a mode was observed experimentally for single enzymes, 
%an observation that implied that the fluctuations in single enzyme concentrations can have cell-wide consequences, even affecting the growth rate of the cell \cite{Kiviet2014}.
%When observed in our experimental context, this would imply that 
%
Finally, the common scenario relates to propagation of noise that arises in the metabolite concentration as a result of fluctuations arising in metabolic processes.
This mode represents a situation where such fluctuations have simultaneous effects on growth and protein production, which led to positive values of $R_{C,\mu}(\tau)$ for both 
positive and negative $\tau$ values, whilst correlations with concentration lagged slightly behind.
Cross-correlations for the common scenario are shown in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig4}.D.
%
We then proceeded to use these scenarios as a reference to interpret our own experimentally obtained cross-correlations.

%\subsubsection*{The experimental cross-correlations point to an active role of the negative feedback, even in a constant environment}
%\subsubsection*{Experiments hint to an active role of feedback in constant environment}
%\subsubsection*{Experiments are consistent with an active role for negative feedback in a constant environment}
\subsubsection*{An active role of feedback in constant environment}

Firstly we inspected the experimentally obtained cross-correlations of the constitutive reporter (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.C and \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.D).
Expression of the constitutive reporter is not expected to influence metabolic processes, nor is its expression a proxy for expression of other proteins that should.
Hence, expression of the constitutive reporter is not expected to affect growth.
Consistently, the cross-correlations appeared to match with the dilution scenario, in which protein fluctuations are not correlated with future growth correlations.
%
This is the case both for the wild type cells and the feedback-less $\Delta$cAMP cells.
%
Next, we looked at the dynamics of the metabolic reporter, which was distinctively different for the wild type cells in comparison with the feedback-less $\Delta$cAMP cells (figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.A and \ref{fig:CRP:fig3}.B).
%
The wild type cells also showed cross-correlations that seem similar to the dilution scenario.
This implied that in wild type cells with feedback regulation, no fluctuations are propagated from metabolic expression to growth.
%
On the other hand, the $\Delta$cAMP cells without feedback, showed different cross-correlations.
%
This was harder to directly connect to one of the scenarios, as the combination of $R_{C,\mu}(\tau)$ and $R_{p,\mu}(\tau)$ curves did not seem to fit any of the three presented scenarios.
%
The experimental 
%Specifically, 
$R_{p,\mu}(\tau)$ cross-correlation showed a much higher peak than the $R_{C,\mu}(\tau)$ cross-correlation.
%
This led us to the hypothesis that the dynamics might be a combination of all three scenarios, where part of the positive $R_{C,\mu}(\tau)$ correlations from the common mode are counteracted by negative dilution mode $R_{C,\mu}(\tau)$ correlations,
which might give the experimentally observed appearance of the cross-correlations.
%
Indeed, when we used our model to simulate a combination of all three scenarios, we obtained cross-correlation curves that seemed consistent with this idea; see figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig4}.E.
%
%Perhaps we are now in a position to understand the effect of the negative feedback, 
This put us in a position where we could understand the effect of the negative feedback,
%Might this also allow us to understand the effect of the feedback?
%
since we could introduce the effect of feedback in our hypothetical combined scenario for feedback-less cells.
%
(This was done by adding a negative component to the $x\rightarrow{p}$ coupling, i.e. decreasing $T_{x\leftarrow{p}}$ only.)
%
Strikingly, indeed, we saw that if we add feedback to the mixed scenario presented in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig4}.E, it began to resemble the dilution mode --- as presented in figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig4}.F.
%
Thus, although this model is rather simple and a biological cell much more complicated, %it could give a hint of what is going on in the cell:
the cross-correlations are consistent with modeling results 
in which the CRP-regulation by negative feedback plays an active role even in a constant environment.
Specifically, it suggests that the CRP regulation might help to filter out metabolic fluctuations and prevent them from having cell-wide effects, such as on the cellular growth rate.


%Hence, as expected, 
%
%Consistent with the ideas presented in the previous paragraph, the constitutive reporter, of which expression is not thought to be correlated with any process that impacts metabolism, 
%shows cross-correlations that are consistent with the dilution scenario.
%%
%Indeed, as its expression is not expected to have an effect, no positive correlations are found for any $\tau$ value and

\section*{Conclusions}

In this chapter, 
we investigated how the CRP regulatory networks responds to environmental inputs versus stochastic inputs.
%
A negative feedback loop, which inhibits CRP activity (through cAMP) 
%and metabolic enzymes expression 
when metabolite concentrations increase,
is known to be responsible for adjusting metabolic enzyme expression to the growth medium of the cell.
%
We hypothesized that this regulatory interaction should respond equally strong to metabolite fluctuations that occur in the cell due to noise. 

We first showed that 
%To show that 
this is a feasible idea, we first subjected the CRP system to a quickly changing cAMP input signal.
To artificially control the input signal, we used $\Delta$cAMP cells that do not respond to internal regulation, but instead responded to the cAMP concentration that we provided in the cellular growth medium.
We also introduced a reporter construct to gauge the metabolic enzyme expression levels.
%\textit{cya} \textit{cpd} null mutants to 
%
The cellular response to an input that alternated between a high and low signal showed that 
it takes hours before cells reach a new steady state, but much less than an hour before a change in metabolic expression or growth rate can be detected.
%The cellular response to our alternating high/low signal showed that it takes a while before 
%The response to an input that alternated between a high and a low signal in 1 or 5 hour blocks 
%showed 
%When we subjected cells to input that alternated between a high and a low cAMP signal in 1 or 5 hour blocks,
%the metabolic enzyme expression and growth rate 
%
We thus concluded that cellular networks have the potential to quickly react to changing inputs such as stochastic fluctuations in metabolite concentration.

Next, we wanted to 
% expose 
uncover
the regulatory dynamics, if any, of the CRP system to stochastic input signals.
%
%We grew $\Delta$cAMP cells at
%a cAMP concentration that was chosen such that the cells grow at wild growth rates.
We grew  $\Delta$cAMP cells in 800 $\upmu$M cAMP,
a concentration that was chosen to sustain growth rates that compare to wild type growth rates.
%
This resulted in cells that expressed the right amount of metabolic enzymes, 
but whose CRP regulation could not respond to stochastically changing metabolite concentrations.
%
By comparing metabolic expression versus growth scatter plots of these $\Delta$cAMP cells with
scatter plots of wild type cells (which could respond to both environmental and stochastic inputs)  
we saw that metabolism-growth dynamics was markedly different between the two conditions.
%
Since the absence 
%removal 
of stochastic input to the CRP system resulted in a change in metabolism-growth dynamics, 
we interpreted this as evidence that the CRP system responds to stochastic fluctuations in metabolite concentrations.

To further investigate what these changes in dynamics mean, 
we not only compared metabolic expression values with growth rates that were both obtained at the same point in time,
but also calculated the correlation between metabolic expression with past, current and future growth rates.
%
This was done by calculating cross-correlations.
%
Using CCs we saw that correlations in the feedback-less $\Delta$cAMP cells and wild type were different over a wide range of delays.
%
This strengthened our idea that stochastic fluctuations have a profound effect on the CRP regulatory system dynamics.

In order to understand the meaning of the difference in dynamics, we used a stochastic differential equation model.
%
This model showed that in experiments without feedback, metabolism-growth dynamics are consistent with modelled dynamics that are influenced by fluctuations in enzyme expression, metabolism itself and volume growth.
% 
However, with feedback, the metabolism-growth dynamics were consistent with modelled dynamics that were dominated by fluctuations in volume growth only.
%
This suggested to us that the negative feedback regulation might actually 
%function to respond to stochastic input, which is to 
prevent fluctuations in metabolism from spreading throughout the cellular biochemical network.

\subsection*{Discussion & outlook}

We have observed that the CRP metabolic regulation responds to stochastic fluctuations in cellular concentrations.
%
This is consistent with earlier observations where it was shown that 
in a synthetic gene circuit, 
regulatory interactions can result in different protein production rates due to cellular heterogeneity \cite{Rosenfeld2005}.
%
The negatively sloped relationship between metabolic enzyme expression and growth that we observe, 
was also consistent with the so called C-line law \cite{You2013} that applies to growth on different conditions.
%
The idea behind that law is that some carbon sources provide a higher energy yield, which allows cells to express less metabolic enzymes and spent more resources on other cellular processes, leading to a higher growth rate.
%
Since cells in our experiments grow in the same environment, such an explanation does not apply to our observations.
%
We thus argue that the observed trend is to be understood in the context of the underlying growth-metabolism dynamics.

Given the observed interaction of the negative feedback with the stochastic fluctuations, 
we also investigated whether the coefficient of variation (CV) of the growth rate was higher for $\Delta$cAMP cells compared to wild type cells.
%
As supplementary figure \ref{fig:CRP:overviewsummaryparams} shows, it is indeed very slightly higher, but more data is required to make statistical claims.

A question one might ask is: why do not all single cells simply grow at the rate of the fastest growing cell in the population?
%
Our observations suggest that stochastic fluctuations simply have to large cellular implications for cells to achieve that.
%
On the other hand, a versatile population might have an evolutionary benefit that outweighs the population average reduction in growth rate.
%
In other words, it could also be that there is no evolutionary pressure for cells to all become fast growing but similar individuals.

To further probe these questions, one could device additional experiments.
%
For example, xylose is a sugar source for which it was observed that concentrations need to fall in a very narrow concentration range to observe growth at all \cite{Towbin2017personalcomm}. 
%
Growing cells in such a sugar source might provide an opportunity to observe a bigger effects of feedback removal than in growth on lactose.
%
Furthermore, an interesting control to compare our experiments involving $\Delta$cAMP cells with might be to investigate controlled expression of constitutively active CRP (CRP*), which could also be used to remove the negative feedback. A disadvantge of that experimental setup might be that the known constitutive forms of CRP have a rather low activity, or are still mildly responsive to cAMP \cite{Aiba1985, Garges1985}.
%
More generally, another question might be what 
(1) CRP IS INVOLVED OTHER PROCESSES > CONSEQUENCES
(2) HOW DOES THIS AFFECT OTHER REGULATION

Cells were introduced into microfluidic device 2 (see chapter \ref{chapter:filarecovery}) with a syringe, after which the device was placed under the microscope in a 37 $\degree$C temperature chamber and we supplied TY medium (flow rate 8 $\upmu$l/min) for a few hours, whereafter we switched to M9 minimal medium plus 0.2 mM uracil, 0.1 $\%$ lactose, 0.01 $\%$ tween and 300 $\upmu$M cAMP (flow rate 7 $\upmu$l/min).
After this cells were grown in the same medium but supplemented with 0.001 $\%$ tween and sequentially 1hr of 2100 $\upmu$M cAMP ("high") and 1hr of 43 $\upmu$M cAMP ("low"), which was repeated 5 times (totaling 10hrs), and then 5 hrs low, 5 hrs high, and 5 hrs low (all at a flow rate of 8 $\upmu$l/min). 
Times at which the valve switches were recorded and in the analysis corrected by adding the arrival delay of 58 minutes (in this particular experiment that delay was not yet optimized).
Fluorescent images were taken every 20 minutes, using a CFP and YFP filter set (chroma models 49001 and 49003 respectively), both with exposure times of 150ms.
A selection of this sequence was analyzed and displayed.  
Data in the figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig2} is based on experiments in which the same physical xenon arc light bulb was used to measure fluorescence for each experiment.
Figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig3} is based on experiments in similar conditions, but contains more experiments, which also include experiments with a different fluorescent light bulb.

\textbf{More detailed information on the computer analyses.} 
For a description of the computer analyses and more information see chapters \ref{chapter:methods} and \ref{chapter:filarecovery}.
%Extended information can be found in chapters \ref{chapter:methods} and \ref{chapter:filarecovery}. 
However, some details are also worth mentioning here. 
Since concentrations, production rates and growth rates play a large role in this chapter, it is good to indicate how they are calculated.
Concentration (a.u./px) is defined as the mean fluorescence signal (a.u.) in a central bar of pixels along the cell's long axis \cite{Kiviet2010}.
%
To calculate the production rate (a.u. px$^{-1}$ min$^{-1}$), first the sum of the fluorescence signal (a.u.) over all pixels that make up a cell is calculated. 
For each frame $n$ where a fluorescence image was taken, the production rate is determined as the slope of a linear fit through three points $n-\delta{n}$, $n$, and $n+\delta{n}$, where $\delta{n}$ is the interval at which fluorescence pictures are taken. This production rate is then subsequently divided by the total number of pixels of the cell in frame $n$.
The growth rate (with units dbl/hr or sometimes with units /min) is determined for each frame $n$ by fitting an exponential curve through frames $n-\delta{n}/2$ until $n+\delta{n}/2$ (or sometimes a smaller range).
Note that to determine scatter plots and correlations, only frames where fluorescence images were taken are considered.
This means that the choice for a growth rate fitting window of width $\delta{n}+1$ ensures that all data is used, but no point is used twice
