\section{Introduction}


%%% ------------------------
% Let's first define the problem (or knowledge gap)
%%% ------------------------

The world is unpredictable.
%
A bacterial cell observes both its extracellular environment and its intracellular environment,
and adjusts its gene expression to 
optimize its chances of survival in this world.
%
%To survive bacteria need to respond to unforeseen situations and express the right gene at the right time. 
% Expressing the right gene at the right time is vital for bacterial survival. 
%Cells rely on biochemical networks to control gene expression.
%(Biochemical network is a general term that refers to the chemical interactions between proteins and small molecular mechanisms.)
To control gene expression a bacterium --- like any other cell --- relies on chemical interactions between proteins and small molecules \cite{Bray1995, Alon2006, Alon2007, Tyson2010}.
%A bacterium, like any other cell, relies on chemical interactions between proteins and small molecules to control gene expression \cite{Bray1995, Alon2006, Alon2007, Tyson2010}.

%dynamics.
%
%On one hand, the extracellular environment might change, and a different gene expression profile is required.
Changes in the extracellular environment might require the cell to adjust gene expression accordingly.
%
On the other hand,  even without environmental changes, the stochastic nature of chemical reactions can lead to fluctuations of proteins and metabolites over time within the cell \cite{Elowitz2002,Kiviet2014}.
The architecture of the biochemical network might enable the cell to deal with these fluctuations, or even use them to its advantage (see also chapter \ref{chapter:literaturereview}).
%
%Studies often focus on how the biochemical network is designed to deal with either one or the other of these two types of dynamics.
%Studies often investigate network architecture in only one of these contexts.
%Studies often investigate network architecture in only an "environmental" context or only in a "stochastic fluctuation" context.
Studies often investigate network architecture only in the context of "environmental" inputs, or only in the context of "stochastic fluctuation" inputs.

%%% ------------------------
% Explaining what is known about the CRP system
%%% ------------------------

%To investigate this question, we take a closer look at the dynamics of regulation by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP; previously called catabolite gene activator protein, or CAP). 
To investigate this question we need a model system.
%
Here, we take a closer look at the dynamics of regulation by the cAMP receptor protein (CRP; previously called catabolite gene activator protein, or CAP). 
%
CRP controls 378 promoters, among which 70 transcription factors \cite{Green2014, Shimada2011}.
%
It has been suggested that CRP controls the expression level of all catabolic genes in concert \cite{You2013, Hui2015};
%
among its targets are all enzymes in the TCA cycle, see also figure \ref{fig:CRP:figOverviewTCARegulation}.
%
Catabolic genes convert large carbohydrate molecules into smaller metabolites, and generate energy for the cell during this process in the form of ATP \cite{Nelson2005}.
%
CRP is activated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), 
which is produced from ATP by the enzyme adenylate cyclase (CyaA).
Adenylate cyclase is thought to be inhibited by $\upalpha$-ketoacids, such as oxaloacetate (OAA), $\upalpha$-ketoglutarate ($\upalpha$-KG) and pyruvate (PYR) \cite{You2013}.
(Previously, also the phosphorylated enzyme IIA of the phosphotransferase system was thought to activate adenylate cyclase \cite{Keseler2017, Deutscher2008, Gorke2008}, but it has now been suggested that the role of $\upalpha$-ketoacids feedback is bigger \cite{You2013}.)
%
Thus, the CRP-cAMP regulation is wired such that metabolites from the TCA cycle and glycolysis pathway provide negative feedback on metabolic enzyme expression.
It is thought that this negative feedback in the CRP regulatory system
is responsible for adjusting the concentration of metabolic enzymes in the cell to the carbohydrate nutrient source available to the cell \cite{Towbin2017}. 
%
More specifically, to maximize growth rate, the cell needs to properly allocate its protein pool among different generic activities such as catabolism, anabolism, protein production, and replication of DNA \cite{Hui2015}.
The negative feedback loop is thought to enable the cell to estimate what the best concentration of metabolic enzymes is under most conditions
and set enzyme expression accordingly \cite{Towbin2017}, see also figure \ref{fig:CRP:fig0}.A.
%
However, when the cell is growing steadily on a single carbon source for an extended period of time, 
there is still a large heterogeneity observed in growth rates and enzyme expression levels \cite{Kiviet2014} (see also chapter \ref{chapter:literaturereview}).
%
%Observations by Kiviet et al. suggest that single cell stochastic fluctuations in enzyme levels result in changes in metabolite fluxes, and eventually fluctuations in growth rate \cite{Kiviet2014}.
Observations by Kiviet et al. suggest that single cell enzyme concentrations fluctuate stochastically over time, which in turn results in fluctuations in metabolite fluxes and eventually in growth rate \cite{Kiviet2014}.
%
Thus, single cell metabolite concentrations might fluctuate over time.
%This observation also implies that there might be large fluctuations in the pool of metabolites available to the cell.
That would imply that also the CRP system receives a variety of inputs due to stochastic fluctuations in single cells, even though there are no changes in the extracellular environment.
%
To investigate whether the CRP system responds to these stochastic input signals, 
% DECOUPLING STORY LINE IS NONSENSE SINCE WE KILL BOTH EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL INPUT AND INSTEAD HAVE cAMP
%we need a way to decouple 
%the response to the external fluctuations

This negative feedback interaction is responsible for adjusting metabolic enzyme concentrations to different sugar sources in bacterial growth medium \cite{Towbin2017, Doucette2011, You2013}.

When we pick two cells within a population, their individual growth rates can easily differ by a factor of two, 
as shown by single cell experiments that measured coefficients of variation (CV, standard deviation divided by the mean).
%
Both the CV of instantaneous growth rates (single cell mass doubling rate) and cellular generation time (time between divisions) has been determined to lay between $0.2$-$0.4$ \cite{Kiviet2014, Hashimoto2016}.
%
Also gene expression is known to vary for a long time \cite{Elowitz2002}, 
the CV of gene expression from any promoter lies above 0.1 \cite{Keren2015}.


This has been suggested to influence gene regulation \cite{Rosenfeld2005}.

\section{Discussion}

\textbf{Talking points.} Evolution doesn't separate dynamic and steady state functionality, and can potentially optimize both.


For example, how cellular composition changes in response to different food sources has been a topic of study for a long time \cite{Schaechter1958}.
%
Regulation of metabolism has recently been shown to fit into a larger picture, in which the cell co-regulates large groups of genes together.
Each of these groups (also called sectors), relate to a major

\cite{Klumpp2009, You2013, Scott2014, Hui2015, Hermsen2015, Erickson2017}.
%
% Note that Erickson is not really growth laws itself, but more about how a switch between two environments occurs
%
An important player in regulating the size of the metabolic sector is the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) \cite{Keseler2017, Grainger2005, Robinson1998, Zheng2004, Gorke2008, Fic2009, Green2014}.
%
CRP is activated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and it controls 378 promoters, among which 70 transcription factors \cite{Green2014, Shimada2011}.
%
The CRP.cAMP regulation

Recently, it has been shown that the CRP.cAMP regulation 

%So-called growth laws describe how the ratio between these sectors is controlled by the cells to adapt to different environments.
%
%For some sectors, it is known that their expression level can be controlled by a single molecule or protein.
%For example, guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) controls ribosomal expression \cite{Cashel1969, Potrykus2008, Ross2013, Hui2015}, and the 
%cAMP receptor protein (CRP) controls expression of metabolic enzymes.

\cite{chubukov2014} has a few nice graphs about different "activities" that need to happen in the cell (ie. categories of metabolites and how they are produced.) Also explains how CRP is controlled! Point to YOu2013 for a-kg inhibition feedback loop.

Stewart-Ornstein 2017 \cite{Stewart-Ornstein2017} was sent by Sander, mentions CRP, so quickly check whether might be interesting.
