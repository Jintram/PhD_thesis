% Let's first define the problem (or knowledge gap)
%%% ------------------------

The world is unpredictable. To survive bacteria need to respond to unforeseen situations and express the right gene at the right time. 
% Expressing the right gene at the right time is vital for bacterial survival. 
%Cells rely on biochemical networks to control gene expression.
%(Biochemical network is a general term that refers to the chemical interactions between proteins and small molecular mechanisms.)
A bacterium, like any other cell, relies on chemical interactions between proteins and small molecules to control gene expression \cite{Bray1995, Alon2006, Alon2007, Tyson2010}.
%These interactions are also referred to as "biochemical networks".
These interactions, also referred to as "biochemical networks",

%dynamics.
%
On one hand, the extracellular environment might change, and a different gene expression profile is required.
On the other hand,  even without environmental changes, the stochastic nature of chemical reactions can lead to fluctuations of proteins and metabolites over time within the cell \cite{Elowitz2002,Kiviet2014}.
The architecture of the biochemical network might enable the cell to deal with these fluctuations, or even use them to its advantage (see also chapter \ref{chapter:literaturereview}).
%
%Studies often focus on how the biochemical network is designed to deal with either one or the other of these two types of dynamics.
%Studies often investigate network architecture in only one of these contexts.
Studies often investigate network architecture in only an "environmental" context or only in a "stochastic fluctuation" context.

%
%It is unclear to what extend regulatory interactions that are known to help the cell deal with a changing environment are affected by stochastic concentration fluctuations
This might have implications for the optimal network architecture.
%
In this work, we address the open question that connects the two:
%
are regulatory interactions that are known for their role in adaptation to environmental changes also affected by concentration fluctuations in the intracellular environment due to noise?

% Now illustrate the setting a bit more

To investigate this question, we take a closer look to the dynamics of the cAMP receptor protein (CRP).


\section{More content}

Some regulatory interactions are known to help the cell deal with changes in the environment, but it is unclear how these regulatory interactions respond to concentration changes due to stochastic fluctuations.
%
In this chapter, we address this open question by looking at the cAMP receptor protein (CRP), of which the 


Studies often focus on how biochemical networks either one of these dynamics


%
An example of biochemical networks responding to extracellular change is the adjustment of enzymatic concentrations to changes in extracellular sugar sources \cite{Towbin2017}.
%For example, when extracellular food source changes, enzymatic concentrations are adjusted accordingly \cite{Towbin2017}.
But even in a constant environment, the stochastic nature of chemical reactions can lead to variations in concentrations of cellular components  \cite{Elowitz2002,Kiviet2014}, 
%Intracellular changes can result from the stochastic nature of chemical reactions \cite{Elowitz2002,Kiviet2014}, 
and a myriad of examples exist of how the biochemical network is designed to both deal with and take advantage of this noise (see also chapter \ref{chapter:literaturereview}).
One example is the suppression of spontaneous fluctuations of concentrations of proteins and metabolites by negative feedback \cite{Brandman2008, Lestas2010, Bowsher2013}.
%
These two functions --- responding to intracellular on one hand and responding to extracellular changes on the other --- are usually considered separately.

In this chapter, we investigate how these two functions --- responding to intracellular on one hand and responding to extracellular changes on the other --- that are usually considered separately, are related to each other.


Specifically, we focus on the regulatory negative feedback by the metabolite alpha-ketoglutarate ($\upalpha$-KG) on metabolic enzyme production through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cAMP receptor protein (CRP)\footnote{Previously also called catabolite gene activator protein (CAP).} a interaction that is responsible for adjusting metabolic enzyme concentrations to different sugar sources in bacterial growth medium \cite{Towbin2017, Doucette2011, You2013} and ask (a) whether this regulatory interaction is affected by stochastic concentration fluctuations in its input and (b) whether CRP

% WHAT'S THE GAP?!!!!

\section{Introduction}

% IDEA: FIRST GENERAL QUESTION, THEN LATER GO INTO DETAILS

A straightforward view of cells growing in a constant environment might be 
that of an expanding collection of individual cells that are each perfectly adapted to the environment.
%
Each cell senses the environment, 
conveys this information using intracellular signaling molecules, 
and adjusts its gene expression accordingly to 
% This adaptation occurs by biochemical networks, 
% which make sure that the cell 
express the right amount of proteins that fit the situation \cite{Bray1995, Alon2006, Alon2007, Tyson2010}.
%
This might imply that the cellular behavior solely depends on the environment of the cell.
%
However, as discussed in chapter {chapter:literaturereview}, cellular populations are very heterogeneous \cite{Kiviet2014, Hashimoto2016}.
%
Since intracellular signaling molecules are not isolated from intracellular fluctuations, 
this might also have an effect on gene regulation.
%
Indeed, it has been found that the input-output relationship between a gene's activator and its expression can be different from one cell to the next \cite{Rosenfeld2005, Keegstra2017}.

[Intracellular messenger molecules might (i) measure fluctuating intracellular concentrations, (ii) fluctuate themselves, 
%
When we pick two cells within a population, their individual growth rates can easily differ by a factor of two, 
as shown by single cell experiments that measured coefficients of variation (CV, standard deviation divided by the mean).
%
Both the CV of instantaneous growth rates (single cell mass doubling rate) and cellular generation time (time between divisions) has been determined to lay between $0.2$-$0.4$ \cite{Kiviet2014, Hashimoto2016}.
%
Also gene expression is known to vary for a long time \cite{Elowitz2002}, 
the CV of gene expression from any promoter lies above 0.1 \cite{Keren2015}.


This has been suggested to influence gene regulation \cite{Rosenfeld2005}.

\section{Introduction}

%Cellular survival critically depends on cellular decision making.
%Biochemical networks allow cells to express the right genes at the right time \cite{Bray1995, Alon2006, Alon2007, Tyson2010}.

Cellular survival strongly depends on expressing the right genes at the right time.
Biochemical networks control when a gene is expressed \cite{Bray1995, Alon2006, Alon2007, Tyson2010}.

Often, biochemical networks are studied in the context of a changing environment.

\section{Discussion}

\textbf{Talking points.} Evolution doesn't separate dynamic and steady state functionality, and can potentially optimize both.


For example, how cellular composition changes in response to different food sources has been a topic of study for a long time \cite{Schaechter1958}.
%
Regulation of metabolism has recently been shown to fit into a larger picture, in which the cell co-regulates large groups of genes together.
Each of these groups (also called sectors), relate to a major 
%
% Recently, it has been shown that large groups of genes are co-regulated, these groups are also called sectors, each of which relate to a major category of cellular activity such as 
category of cellular activity such as 
metabolism, anabolism, protein synthesis, replication, etc 
%catabolism, metabolism, anabolism, , protein synthesis, replication, etc. 
\cite{Klumpp2009, You2013, Scott2014, Hui2015, Hermsen2015, Erickson2017}.
%
% Note that Erickson is not really growth laws itself, but more about how a switch between two environments occurs
%
An important player in regulating the size of the metabolic sector is the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) \cite{Keseler2017, Grainger2005, Robinson1998, Zheng2004, Gorke2008, Fic2009, Green2014}.
%
CRP is activated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and it controls 378 promoters, among which 70 transcription factors \cite{Green2014, Shimada2011}.
%
The CRP.cAMP regulation 
%
Recently, it has been shown that the CRP.cAMP regulation 

%So-called growth laws describe how the ratio between these sectors is controlled by the cells to adapt to different environments.
%
%For some sectors, it is known that their expression level can be controlled by a single molecule or protein.
%For example, guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp) controls ribosomal expression \cite{Cashel1969, Potrykus2008, Ross2013, Hui2015}, and the 
%cAMP receptor protein (CRP) controls expression of metabolic enzymes.

Fig. S2 is already worth it because it gives nice overview between how glycolysis convert glucose to pyruvate and then either ferments it or aerobically burns it to CO2 (+acetate).

\cite{chubukov2014} has a few nice graphs about different "activities" that need to happen in the cell (ie. categories of metabolites and how they are produced.) Also explains how CRP is controlled! Point to YOu2013 for a-kg inhibition feedback loop.

Stewart-Ornstein 2017 \cite{Stewart-Ornstein2017} was sent by Sander, mentions CRP, so quickly check whether might be interesting.

Perhaps it is interesting to check out the network topology validation by Michael Stumpf (see Heidelberg Quant conference 2017).
