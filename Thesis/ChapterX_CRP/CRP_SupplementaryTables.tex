% ASC838	& 		& MG1655 wild type strain bBT12; CGSC nr: 8003, which contains a Fnr- mutation. This is the basis for all Towbin et al. strains. & \cite{Towbin2017} \\
ASC840 & $\Delta$CRP &	\textit{cyaA} \textit{crp} null mutant, also known as bBT92. In addition to the \textit{crp} gene, also the \textit{cyaA} gene has been knocked out, since some of the constitutive CRP proteins still have a residual response to cAMP. & \cite{Towbin2017} \\

ASC843	&	& MG1655 WT strain (bBT12) + GFP w/o promoter PSCS101 (control), plasmid aka pU66 (kanamycin resistance on plasmid). & \cite{Towbin2017} \\

ASC847	&	pHA5	& p\_CRP-CRP construct in a pBR322 plasmid; stored in DH5$\upalpha$. This is the CRP protein sequence behind its native promoter. (Ampicilin resistance on plasmid.) & \cite{Aiba1985, Towbin2017} \\
ASC845	&	pHA7	& p\_bla-CRP construct in a pBR322 plasmid; stored in DH5$\upalpha$. This is the CRP protein behind a bla promoter. (Ampicilin resistance on plasmid.) & \cite{Aiba1985, Towbin2017} \\
ASC859	&	pHA7*1	& p\_bla-CRP*1 construct in a pBR322 plasmid; stored in DH5$\upalpha$. The star indicates this is a constitutively active version of CRP, the number indicates which version. See Aiba et al. for more information \cite{Aiba1985}. (Ampicilin resistance on plasmid.)  & \cite{Aiba1985, Towbin2017} \\

\caption{\textbf{Additional strains produced for this work, but not used in experiments presented here.} ASC stands for AMOLF strain collection.
    FB indicates this strain was acquired by Ferhat B{\"u}ke, a member of both the Sander Tans lab and Greg Bokinsky lab. VS indicates this strain is produced at AMOLF by technician Vanda Sunderlikova.
    Note with ASC844: this plasmid was received from the Alon lab in a DH5$\upalpha$ strain, other plasmids were received purified and were transferred to DH5$\upalpha$ strains at AMOLF.
