Figures are either stored in their respective chapters.

OR

The figures are stored in a dropbox folder  ..../Dropbox/PhDThesis_Figures.

Reason: Figures should be ignored from version control (git) because they are too large. But at the same time I need them to be available from the Amolf computer & laptop

To include the path with figures into the latex document use setFigurePath.tex : It includes 3 locations: 1) The local subfolder "Figures" (relative path) 2) dropbox folder from amolf computer 3) same dropbox folder from personal laptop

**************************************
Standard: store all figures in dropbox folder, not local folder.

Create a portable version: copy the figures into the relative ./Figures/ path.
