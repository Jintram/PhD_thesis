    % General science
    \item The requirement for international experience in academic positions is based on culture, not on merit.
    %
    \item Creating interesting stories out of scientific data leaves a load of stories untold, and labor wasted.    
    % General
    \item One cannot have a meaningful discussion without accepting a non-zero probability that one might not be right.
    % \item The ability to evaluate one's behavior and [zelfkritiek is belangrijk / niet vastroesten in patronen]
    \item Printing a thesis is an outdated concept.
    \item It is better to be lazy than to fail at doing three experiments simultaneously.
    \item Science is too individualistic - only one person working on a project occurs too often.
    \item *Science can learn more from companies*
    \item The culture of admiration for making long hours in science is both counter-productive and unethical.
    \item *gender neutral naming system?*
    \item *about studying how to learn best -- ie. the learning book*
    \item something that there should always be a human that can overrule the decision of an algorithm

    \item Filamentation is not a fringe phenomenon: cells in the real world are often exposed to stressful situations that require growth but no division (chapter \ref{chapter:filarecovery}).
    \item The Min system controls where cells divide in filamentous cells (chapter \ref{chapter:filarecovery}).
    \item Regulation networks, such as the one involving the CRP protein (chapter \ref{chapter:CRP}), not only respond to changing environment external to the cell, but also respond to a stochastically changing environment inside the cell.
    \item Ribosomal proteins do not simply form a the ribosome, instead their differential expression can address precise protein expression needs (chapter \ref{chapter:ribosomes}).
