\section*{A quantitative view on biology}

Biology has long been a crude science \cite{Lazebnik2003}.
%
To understand cellular decision networks, it was deemed sufficient to find out which protein interacted with which other protein or DNA sequence, or what the effect of a protein knockout was.
%
In recent years, the emerging field of systems biology, or quantitative biology, has introduced a new way of thinking.
%In recent years, the emerging field of systems biology has provided us with many insights by \red{try thinking of some examples}
%
By careful quantitative analysis of the cell, and mathematical analyses that might only describe the interactions between a few cellular components, albeit in a minute way, 
one could fundamentally understand and predict decision networks in the cell \cite{Alon2006}.

In this thesis, I will present examples of such ....

In the first chapter of this thesis however, we discuss ...

A good example of a system is the Min system.

The differentiation is driven by stochastic protein production. Figure \figA was taken from \cite{Taniguchi2010}, \figB was taken from \cite{Suel2006}.}

%
%Even in a single species of enzymes, the catalytic rate can vary from one enzyme to the next \cite{Lu1998}. (Interestingly, the average waiting time for a reaction has the same form as the Michaelis Menten equation \cite{Xie2013}.)
%
%Transcription is a bursty process \cite{Golding2005}. 
%
%Global trends in noisy protein expression have been investigated. 
%Noise scales with the amount of protein that is expressed \cite{Bar-Even2006}.
%
%\section{Random notes}
%
%In eukaryotes, it is feasible to detect transcript from the RNA \cite{Levsky2002}.
