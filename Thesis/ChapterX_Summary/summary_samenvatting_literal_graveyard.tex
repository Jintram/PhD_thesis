In this thesis we observe and investigate single cell behaviour.

We cover three topics that relate to division, metabolism and translation.
%These topics relate to three important cellular processes respectively: division, metabolism and translation.

We first discover how cells strictly regulate their division process during recovery from stress.

% BEGIN
\section{extended description of methods chapter}
We first describe in \textbf{chapter \ref{chapter:methods}} how we expanded on current methods to investigate the behavior of single cells.
%
Specifically, we discuss how a new PDMS microfluidic device (developed by Daan Kiviet) to obtain single cell lineage data from growing microcolonies of \textit{Escherichia coli}, and what modifications were required to apply existing analysis algorithms (designed for the analysis of microcolonies grown on gel pads) on the data from this device.
%
We also introduced two simple new algorithms to process the data gathered in this thesis:
a new tracker algorithm and an algorithm to straighten cells and calculate fluorescence intensity along their axes. 
This latter algorithm was later applied to track the location of labeled division rings and nucleoids in chapter \ref{chapter:filarecovery}.
%
Lastly, this methods briefly discusses the topic of cross correlations,
and describes how to create composite cross-correlations from a branched tree structure such as lineage data acquired from microcolonies of growing cells.
%
This is relevant for chapters \ref{chapter:CRP} and \ref{chapter:ribosomes}, where cross-correlations are used to understand the dynamics between 
single cell gene expression and growth.
